</P>
<P>
The international Java community develops and evolves Java? technology 
specifications using the Java Community Process (JCP). The JCP produces high-quality 
specifications in "Internet time" using an inclusive, consensus building 
approach that produces a specification, a reference implementation (to prove the 
specification can be implemented), and a technology compatibility kit (a suite 
of tests, tools, and documentation that is used to test implementations for 
compliance with the specification).
</P>
<P>
Experience has shown that the best way to produce a technology specification is 
to gather a group of industry experts who have a deep understanding of the 
technology in question and then have a strong technical lead work with that 
group to create a first draft. Consensus around the form and content of the 
draft is then built using an iterative review process that allows an ever-widening 
audience to review and comment on the document.
</P>
<P>
This version of the JCP was developed through the JCP by means of JSR 215, led 
by Sun and the combined Executive Committees as the expert group.
</P>
<P>
An Executive Committee (EC) representing a cross-section of both major 
stakeholders and other members of the Java community is responsible for 
approving the passage of specifications through key points of the JCP and for 
reconciling discrepancies between specifications and their associated test 
suites. There are two ECs: one to oversee the Java technologies for the desktop/server 
space (with responsibility for the J2SE? and J2EE? specifications) and the other 
to oversee the Java technologies for the consumer/embedded space (with 
responsibility for the J2ME? specification).
</P>
<P>
There are four major steps in this version of the JCP:
</P>
<OL>
  <LI>
    <P>
    <B>INITIATION</B>: A specification targeted at the desktop/server or consumer/embedded 
    space is initiated by community member(s) and approved for development by the 
    responsible EC.
    </P>
  </LI>
  <LI>
    <P>
    <B>EARLY DRAFT</B>: A group of experts is formed to develop a preliminary draft 
    of the specification that both the community and the public will then review. 
    Anyone with an Internet connection can read and comment on the draft. The expert 
    group uses feedback from the review to revise and refine the draft.
    </P>
  </LI>
  <LI>
    <P>
    <B>PUBLIC DRAFT</B>: The draft goes out again for review by the public. The 
    expert group uses the feedback to further revise the document. At the end of 
    this review, the EC decides if the draft should proceed. If approved by the EC, 
    the leader of the expert group sees that the reference implementation and its 
    associated technology compatibility kit are completed before sending the 
    specification to the responsible EC for final approval.
    </P>
  </LI>
  <LI>
    <P>
    <B>MAINTENANCE</B>: The completed specification, reference implementation, and 
    technology compatibility kit are updated in response to ongoing requests for 
    clarification, interpretation, enhancements, and revisions. The responsible EC 
    can review all proposed changes to the specification and indicate which ones can 
    be carried out immediately and which will require the specification to be 
    revised by an expert group. Challenges to one or more tests in a specification's 
    technology compatibility kit are ultimately decided by the responsible EC if 
    they cannot be otherwise resolved.
    </P>
  </LI>
</OL>
<P>
<A NAME="F"></A> <FONT SIZE="5">FUNDAMENTAL DEFINITIONS </FONT>
</P>
<P>
<B>Java Community Process (JCP)</B>: The formal process described in this 
document for developing or revising Java technology specifications.
</P>
<P>
<B>Java Community Process Member (Member)</B>: A company, organization, or 
individual that has signed the JSPA and is abiding by its terms.
</P>
<P>
<B>Java Specification Participation Agreement (JSPA)</B>: A one-year renewable 
agreement between Sun Microsystems and a company, organization or individual 
that allows the latter entities to participate in the Java Community Process.
</P>
<P>
<B>Individual Expert Participation Agreement (IEPA)</B>: An agreement between 
Sun Microsystems and an individual that allows that individual to serve on an 
Expert Group at the invitation of the Specification Lead. There is no fee 
associated with the IEPA and it is valid until the Expert Group disbands. The 
IEPA allows individual technical experts who do not represent companies or 
organizations to participate on Expert Groups.
</P>
<P>
<B>Executive Committee (EC)</B>: The Members who guide the evolution of the Java 
technologies. The EC represents a cross-section of both major stakeholders and 
other Members of the Java Community. Members must have signed the EC acceptance 
letter in order to serve on the EC. The EC Policies and Procedures are in 
Appendix A.
</P>
<P>
<B>Program Management Office (PMO)</B>: The group within Sun Microsystems that 
is responsible for administering the JCP and chairing the EC.
</P>
<P>
<B>Java Specification (Specification)</B>: A written specification for some 
aspect of the Java technology. This includes the language, virtual machine, 
Platform Editions, Profiles, and application programming interfaces.
</P>
<P>
<B>Platform Edition Specification (Platform Edition)</B>: A Specification that 
defines a baseline API set that provides a foundation upon which applications, 
other APIs, and Profiles can be built. There are currently three Platform 
Edition Specifications: J2SE, J2EE, and J2ME.
</P>
<P>
<B>Profile Specification (Profile)</B>: A Specification that references one of 
the Platform Edition Specifications and zero or more other JCP Specifications (that 
are not already a part of a Platform Edition Specification). APIs from the 
referenced Platform Edition must be included according to the referencing rules 
set out in that Platform Edition Specification. Other referenced specifications 
must be referenced in their entirety.
</P>
<P>
<B>Reference Implementation (RI)</B>: The prototype or "proof of concept" 
implementation of a Specification.
</P>
<P>
<B>Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK)</B>: The suite of tests, tools, and 
documentation that allows an organization to determine if its implementation is 
compliant with the Specification.
</P>
<P>
<B>JCP Web Site</B>: The web site where anyone with an Internet connection can 
stay informed about JCP activities, download draft and final Specifications, and 
follow the progress of Specifications through the JCP.
</P>
<P>
<B>JCP Specification Page (Spec Page)</B>: Each Specification approved for 
development or revision will have a dedicated public web page established on the 
JCP Web Site to contain a history of the passage of the Specification through 
the JCP, including a record of the decisions, actions, and votes taken by the EC 
with respect to the draft Specification.

<P>
Existing Specifications, along with their associated RIs and TCKs, are 
maintained by a designated Maintenance Lead using the processes described in 
section 4 of this document. Maintenance Leads (and their host companies or 
organizations) are expected to assume long term ownership of their 
Specifications, RIs, and TCKs with due respect of the will of the Java Community 
Members with regard to evolution. This means that Maintenance Leads will 
automatically be the Spec Leads for all significant revisions to their 
Specifications going forward but they will not have the exclusive right to 
decide when a significant revision will take place. That will be decided by the 
EC in response to a revision JSR that can be initiated by any Java Community 
Member (or Members). The only provision is that the submitter(s) should make a 
reasonable effort to get some of the members of the previous Expert Group to 
join the revision effort.
</P>
<H4><A NAME="1.1.2"></A> 1.1.2 PROTECT THE INSTALLED BASE AND GUARD AGAINST 
FRAGMENTATION </H4>
<P>
Changes to the Java programming language, the Java virtual machine (JVM), the 
Java Native Interface (JNI), packages in the "java.*" space, or other packages 
delivered as part of J2SE, have the potential to seriously disrupt the installed 
base if carried out inconsistently across the Platform Editions. In order to 
protect the installed base, any such changes can only be accepted and carried 
out within a UJSR for J2SE.
</P>
<P>
In order to guard against fragmentation, new Platform Edition Specifications 
will not substantially duplicate existing Platform Editions or Profiles.
</P>
<H4><A NAME="1.1.3"></A> 1.1.3 PROFILES AND API SPECIFICATIONS TARGET CURRENT 
PLATFORM EDITIONS </H4>
<P>
All new or revised Specifications must be compatible with the most recent 
versions of the targeted Platform Edition Specifications. In order to achieve 
this, all UJSRs to define new Profile Specifications or revise existing Profile 
Specifications must reference the latest version of the Platform Edition 
Specification they are based upon.
</P>
<H4><A NAME="1.1.4"></A> 1.1.4 J2ME PROFILES AND J2ME BUILDING BLOCKS</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <B>definition - J2ME Building Block (Building Block)</B>: A subset of one or 
  more APIs defined in the J2SE or J2EE Platform Edition Specifications. The J2ME 
  Platform Edition Specification is a collection of Building Blocks. J2ME Profile 
  Specifications can build up desired functionality by combining new API sets with 
  existing Building Blocks.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
J2ME Profiles will normally be based upon the existing Java virtual machine and 
language Specifications. When such Profiles also need to include subsets of J2SE 
and/or J2EE functionality, they will reference J2ME Building Blocks.
</P>
<P>
Building Blocks are created and revised within the UJSR for the J2ME Platform 
Specification. It is likely that different J2ME Profiles will require different 
J2SE/J2EE subsets. For example, different categories of devices may need 
different subsets of the "java.net" package. In order to accommodate this, no 
fundamental restrictions are placed upon the number of times or ways in which 
J2SE/J2EE functionality can be packaged into J2ME Building Blocks.
</P>
<P>
Building Blocks can be proposed in a UJSR for the J2ME Specification. However, 
it is recognized that the consumer and device marketplaces can change very 
rapidly in comparison to the desktop and server marketplaces. The definition of 
new Building Blocks (as well as the revision of existing blocks) may need to be 
carried out very quickly in order for some J2ME Profiles to keep up with 
changing market needs. In the interest of speed, J2ME Building Blocks may also 
be defined and revised within the JCP Maintenance Cycle (see section 4.2) for 
the J2ME Specification.
</P>
<P>
Expert Groups that need to quickly create or update a J2ME Building Block should 
approach the Maintenance Lead for the J2ME Platform Edition Specification with 
their requests. The J2ME Maintenance Lead, after consultation with both the J2ME 
Expert Group and the Maintenance Lead(s) of the Platform Edition(s) the block is 
to be derived from, may propose the new Building Block as part of a maintenance 
update to the J2ME specification. Note that the EC can require any Building 
Block proposed as part of the Maintenance Cycle to be defined in a major 
revision to the J2ME Specification (see section 4.2.2).
</P>
<P>
If the Maintenance Lead declines a Building Block request, the requesting Expert 
Group has the options of initiating a UJSR for J2ME (which may be time consuming) 
or creating the needed APIs in any namespace not reserved for use by existing 
Platform Edition Specifications.
</P>
<P>
In exceptional circumstances, the J2ME Specification may define J2ME Building 
Blocks for use with special classes of devices that can only implement subsets 
of the Java virtual machine or language Specifications. Such Building Blocks can 
be defined and approved only within a UJSR for J2ME. They cannot be defined 
using the Maintenance Cycle because proposals for Building Blocks for these 
special classes of devices must be subject to the widest possible review.
</P>
<P>
<B>1.1.5 CONTINUED AVAILABILITY</B>
</P>
<P>
The technology that a JSR defines can be delivered as part of a Profile or 
Platform Edition, it can be delivered stand-alone or both. Future versions of 
the technology may be integrated into a Profile or a Platform Edition while 
previous versions were not. The submitter of a JSR will be required, via the JSR 
submission form, to indicate if it is the submitter's goal to deliver the JSR's 
RI and TCK as part of a Profile or Platform Edition, stand-alone or both. When 
delivering the JSR's RI and TCK integrated into a Profile or Platform Edition 
and not delivering these separately and where the RI and TCK of previous 
versions were available separately, the submitter must state the rationale. Also 
in this case the JSR Review (see section 1.2) will be 4 weeks instead of 14 days.
</P>
<P>
A JSR for a new version of an API that proposes to become part of a Profile or 
Platform Edition and is considering discontinuing stand-alone availability where 
the previous JSR for this API did not indicate this plan, must make that 
proposal to discontinue stand-alone availability one version ahead.&nbsp;
</P>
<P>
<B>1.1.6 PLATFORM INCLUSION</B>
</P>
<P>
JSRs that want to be considered to be included in the definition of a Platform 
Edition or a Profile should describe this intent in the JSR's submission. The 
final decision whether a specific JSR is included in a Profile or a Platform 
Edition is made by the Spec Lead and Expert Group of that Platform Edition JSR 
or Profile JSR, and confirmed by the EC ballots on those JSRs. If the Platform 
Edition or Profile JSR turns down the request for inclusion, then the JSR for 
the API will be required to deliver a stand-alone RI and TCK.

Comments on the JSR should be sent to the e-mail address listed on the JSR Page. 
All comments received will be made available from the JSR Page and forwarded to

</P>
<H3><A NAME="2.1"></A> 2.1 FORM THE EXPERT GROUP </H3>
<P>
When a JSR is approved, the PMO will notify the identified Spec Lead to form the 
Expert Group. If the Member contributing the Spec Lead withdraws from the 
Community before the JSR is approved, the PMO will request the initial Expert 
Group to choose a replacement from among themselves who is willing to take on 
the duties defined in this document (including taking responsibility for the RI 
and TCK, working towards the estimated schedule given in the JSR, and assuming 
the position of Maintenance Lead as described in section 4).
</P>
<P>
There is no size limit on the Expert Group. The Spec Lead may add additional 
Experts at any time provided the existing Expert Group is consulted first. New 
members may be added, for example, to increase diversity of opinion. A Spec Lead 
recruits new Experts by approaching other Members directly and working with them 
to identify an expert and bring him or her into the Expert Group. Individual 
experts can be brought into the Expert Group if they sign an IEPA.
</P>
<H4><A NAME="2.1.1"></A> 2.1.1 FREEDOM OF WORKING STYLE </H4>
<P>
Each Expert Group is free to define and follow whatever working style it finds 
most productive and appropriate as long as it is compatible with the JCP. Use of 
the Internet is encouraged. E-mail exchanges on mailing lists established for 
the use by the Expert Group, along with conference calls and group meetings, 
have been used by past Expert Groups to discuss and resolve issues raised as the 
draft evolves. In-person group meetings are useful but they tend to slow down 
work considerably due to the need to coordinate schedules.
</P>
<P>
While Spec Leads are free to operate Expert Groups in whatever style they feel 
is most appropriate, they are encouraged to choose a style that provides maximal 
transparency to the Expert Group, community, the EC members and the public. The 
PMO provides Spec Leads with tools and techniques for making the actions of 
their Expert Groups transparent, and the EC members expect Spec Leads to 
carefully choose which tools are best for their Expert Groups and commit to 
using them. Transparency is valuable to everyone in the community, especially 
the Expert Group, because it offers broader feedback to the group and helps 
build broader support for the final spec.
</P>
<H4><A NAME="2.1.2"></A> 2.1.2 WITHDRAWAL OF AN EXPERT FROM THE EXPERT GROUP </H4>
<P>
An Expert may withdraw from the Expert Group at any time. When this happens, the 
Spec Lead may approach the Member who originally contributed the Expert and work 
with that organization to find a replacement. If no replacement is offered, the 
Spec Lead may recruit a replacement from another Member if desired. If the 
departing Expert is the Spec Lead, the Expert Group should choose one of its 
members as the new Spec Lead provided he or she is willing to take on all of the 
responsibilities defined in this document.
</P>
<H4><A NAME="2.1.3"></A> 2.1.3 UNCOOPERATIVE OR UNRESPONSIVE EXPERT GROUP 
MEMBERS </H4>
<P>
There may be rare instances when members of the Expert Group feel that one of 
their fellow Experts is not acting in ways that advance the work of the Expert 
Group. These concerns should be brought to the attention of the Spec Lead and/or 
the EC as quickly as possible so they may be proactively addressed and resolved. 
The Expert Group members are expected to make a reasonable effort to resolve any 
such issues among themselves. If a 2/3 majority of the members of the Expert 
Group find that a Spec Lead is being unresponsive, and the Spec Lead does not 
work to resolve the situation in a timely manner, the EC may direct the PMO to 
ask the Member who provided the Spec Lead to provide a replacement.
</P>
<H3><A NAME="2.2"></A> 2.2 WRITE THE FIRST DRAFT OF THE SPECIFICATION </H3>
<P>
The Expert Group should begin work by considering the requirements set forth in 
the JSR, any contributed documents or technology descriptions, comments received 
during JSR Review and, if this is a revision of an existing Specification, the 
Change Log kept by the Maintenance Lead (see section 4). Additional input can be 
obtained from discussions with other Members, industry groups, software 
developers, end-users, and academics. The goal is to define requirements and 
then write a draft specification suitable for review by the Community and the 
public.
</P>
<P>
When the Expert Group decides that the first draft is ready for review, the 
Specification Lead will send the draft, along with any additional files required 
for review, to the PMO. The Specification Lead should also suggest the length of 
the Early Draft Review period if the Expert Group feels it should go beyond the 
minimum 30 days.

Refinement of the draft Specification begins when the PMO posts it to the JCP 
Web Site and announces the start of Early Draft Review to all of the Members and 
the public. Anyone with access to the Internet can download and comment on the 
draft. The goal of Early Draft Review is to get the draft Specification into a 
form suitable for Public Review as quickly as possible by uncovering and 
correcting major problems with the draft. Early Draft Review is an early access 
review, designed to ideally take place when the specification still has some 
unresolved issues. The public's participation in Early Draft Review is an 
important part of the JCP. In the past, comments from the public have raised 
fundamental architectural and technological issues that have considerably 
improved some Specifications.
</P>
<P>
All comments from Members and the public should be sent to the e-mail feedback 
address listed in the draft. The Spec Lead is responsible for ensuring that all 
comments are read and considered. Members have a right to receive a response to 
their comments. For simplicity, similar comments may be combined and responded 
to as one.
</P>
<H4><A NAME="2.3.1"></A> 2.3.1 UPDATING THE DRAFT DURING EARLY DRAFT REVIEW </H4>
<P>
If the Expert Group makes major revisions to the draft during Early Draft Review, 
the Spec Lead should send the revised draft, along with a synopsis of the 
changes, to the PMO. The PMO will notify Members of any updated drafts and 
change synopses received and make them available for download by Members and the 
public.
</P>
<P>
During Early Draft Review, EC members are strongly encouraged to have one or 
more technical members of their organizations carry out a review of the draft in 
order to uncover possible duplication of features or services between the draft 
and other Specifications. EC members should inform the Expert Group of any such 
discoveries using the Member e-mail feedback address listed in the draft so they 
can be considered and responded to like all Member comments. EC member feedback 
is important to the Expert Group, and EC members are encouraged not to wait 
until ballot periods to voice concerns and issues.
</P>

After the Early Draft Review period has ended, the Expert Group can make any 
additional changes to the draft it deems necessary in response to comments 
before submitting the draft to the PMO for Public Review.

members should inform the Expert Group of any such discoveries using the Member 
e-mail feedback address listed in the draft so they can be considered and
