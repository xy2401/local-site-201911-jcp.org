		<div class="header3">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</div> 
  
		&nbsp;<br>
		The international Java community develops and evolves Java&#153; technology specifications using the Java Community Process (JCP). The JCP produces high-quality  specifications in "Internet time" using an inclusive, consensus building approach that produces a specification, a reference implementation (to prove the specification can be implemented), and a technology compatibility kit (a suite of tests, tools, and documentation that is used to test implementations for compliance with the specification). <br>
				
		&nbsp;<br>
		Experience has shown that the best way to produce a technology specification  is to gather a group of industry experts who have a deep understanding of  the technology in question and then have a strong technical lead work with  that group to create a first draft. Consensus around the form and content  of the draft is then built using an iterative review process that allows an ever-widening audience to review and comment on the document.<br>
		
		&nbsp;<br>
		This version of the JCP was developed through the JCP by means of JSR
		99 and JSR 171, led by Sun and the combined Executive Committees as the expert
		group. <br>
		  
		&nbsp;<br>
		An Executive Committee (EC)  representing a cross-section of both major stakeholders and other members  of the Java community is responsible for approving the passage of specifications  through key points of the JCP and for reconciling discrepancies between specifications  and their associated test suites. There are two ECs: one to oversee the Java  technologies for the desktop/server space (with responsibility for the J2SE&#153; and J2EE&#153; specifications) and the other to oversee the Java technologies for the consumer/embedded space (with responsibility for the J2ME&#153; specification). <br>
			
		&nbsp;<br>
		There are four major steps in this version of the JCP:<br>
    
		<ol>
   		<li><b>INITIATION</b>: A specification targeted at the desktop/server or consumer/embedded space is initiated by community member(s) and approved for development by the responsible EC.<br>&nsbp;<br></li>
    	<li><b>COMMUNITY DRAFT</b>: A group of experts is formed to develop a first draft of the specification that both the community and the responsible EC will then review. The expert group uses feedback from the review to revise  and refine the draft. At the end of the review, the responsible EC decides if the draft should proceed to the next step.<br>&nbsp;<br></li>
    	<li><b>PUBLIC DRAFT</b>: The draft goes out for review by the public where  anyone with an Internet connection can read and comment on the draft. The  expert group uses the public feedback to further revise the document. Finally,  the leader of the expert group sees that the reference implementation and  its associated technology compatibility kit are completed before sending the specification to the responsible EC for final approval.<br>&nbsp;<br></li>
    	<li><b>MAINTENANCE</b>: The completed specification, reference implementation, and technology compatibility kit are updated in response to ongoing requests  for clarification, interpretation, enhancements, and revisions. The responsible  EC can review all proposed changes to the specification and indicate which  ones can be carried out immediately and which will require the specification  to be revised by an expert group. Challenges to one or more tests in a specification's  technology compatibility kit are ultimately decided by the responsible EC if they cannot be otherwise resolved. </li>
		</ol>

		&nbsp;<br>
		<b>Java Community Process (JCP)</b>: The formal process described in this document for developing or revising Java technology specifications.<br>
    
		&nbsp;<br>
		<b>Java Community Process Member (Member)</b>: A company, organization,  or individual that has signed the JSPA and is abiding by its terms. <br>
    
		&nbsp;<br>
		<b>Java Specification Participation Agreement (JSPA)</b>: A one-year renewable agreement between Sun Microsystems and a company, organization or individual that allows the latter entities to participate in the Java Community Process.<br>
    
		&nbsp;<br>
		<b>Individual Expert Participation Agreement (IEPA)</b>: An agreement  between Sun Microsystems and an individual that allows that individual to  serve on an Expert Group at the invitation of the Specification Lead. There  is no fee associated with the IEPA and it is valid until the Expert Group  disbands. The IEPA allows individual technical experts who do not represent  companies or organizations to participate on Expert Groups.<br>
    
		&nbsp;<br>
		<b>Executive Committee (EC)</b>: The Members who guide the evolution of the Java technologies. The EC represents a cross-section of both major stakeholders and other Members of the Java Community. Members must have signed the EC acceptance letter in order to serve on the EC. The EC Policies and Procedures are in Appendix A.<br>
    
		&nbsp;<br>
		<b>Program Management Office (PMO)</b>: The group within Sun Microsystems that is responsible for administering the JCP and chairing the EC.<br>
    
		&nbsp;<br>
		<b>Java Specification (Specification)</b>: A written specification for some aspect of the Java technology. This includes the language, virtual machine,  Platform Editions, Profiles, and application programming interfaces.<br>
    
		&nbsp;<br>
		<b>Platform Edition Specification (Platform Edition)</b>: A Specification that defines a baseline API set that provides a foundation upon which applications, other APIs, and Profiles can be built. There are currently three Platform  Edition Specifications: J2SE, J2EE, and J2ME.<br>
    
		&nbsp;<br>
		<b>Profile Specification (Profile)</b>: A Specification that references one of the Platform Edition Specifications and zero or more other JCP Specifications (that are not already a part of a Platform Edition Specification). APIs from  the referenced Platform Edition must be included according to the referencing rules set out in that Platform Edition Specification. Other referenced specifications must be referenced in their entirety.<br>
    
		&nbsp;<br>
		<b>Reference Implementation (RI)</b>: The prototype or "proof of concept" implementation of a Specification.<br>
    
		&nbsp;<br>
		<b>Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK)</b>: The suite of tests, tools, and documentation that allows an implementor of a Specification to determine if their implementation is compliant with that Specification.<br>
    
		&nbsp;<br>
		<b>JCP Web Site</b>: The web site where anyone with an Internet connection can stay informed about JCP activities, download draft and final Specifications, and follow the progress of Specifications through the JCP.<br>
    
		&nbsp;<br>
		<b>JCP Specification Page (Spec Page)</b>: Each Specification approved for development or revision will have a dedicated public web page established  on the JCP Web Site to contain a history of the passage of the Specification through the JCP, including a record of the decisions, actions, and votes  taken by the EC with respect to the draft Specification.<br>

		<div class="header4">1.1 INITIATE A JAVA SPECIFICATION REQUEST</div>
     
		<blockquote>     
		<b>definition - Java Specification Request (JSR)</b>: The document submitted to the PMO by one or more Members to propose the development of a new Specification or significant revision to an existing Specification. <br>
        
  		&nbsp;<br>
		<b>definition - Umbrella Java Specification Request (UJSR)</b>: A JSR that defines or revises a Platform Edition or Profile Specification. A UJSR proceeds through the JCP like any other JSR.<br>
        
  		&nbsp;<br>
		<b>definition - Expert</b>: A Member representative (or an individual who has signed the IEPA) who has expert knowledge and is an active practitioner in the technology covered by the JSR.<br>
        
  		&nbsp;<br>
		<b>definition - Expert Group</b>: The group of Experts who develop or make significant revisions to a Specification.<br>
        
  		&nbsp;<br>
		<b>definition - Specification Lead (Spec Lead)</b>: The Expert responsible for leading the effort to develop or make significant revisions to a Specification and for completing the associated Reference Implementation and Technology Compatibility Kit. A Spec Lead (or their host company or organization) must  be a Java Community Process Member.<br>
   		</blockquote>
        
		&nbsp;<br>
		One or more Members can initiate a request to develop a new Specification, or carry out a significant revision to an existing one, by sending a JSR to the PMO. The JSR must use the template  available at the JCP Web Site. The JSR serves to identify the Members making  the request (the sponsors), a Specification Lead, and the initial members  of the Expert Group. It will also describe the proposed Specification, the  reason(s) for developing or revising it, the primary target Java Platform  Edition, an estimated development schedule, and any preexisting documents,  technology descriptions, or implementations that might be used as a starting  point. Any JSR under consideration can be withdrawn by its sponsors without  explanation at any time prior to the completion of the JSR approval vote (see section 1.3) upon request by the initiator(s) to the PMO.<br>
    
    	<a name="1.1.1"></a>     
		<h4>1.1.1 REVISE EXISTING SPECIFICATIONS</h4>           
		Existing Specifications, along with their associated RIs and TCKs, are  maintained by a designated Maintenance Lead using the processes described  in section 4 of this document. Maintenance Leads (and their host company or organization) are expected to assume long term ownership of their Specification,  RI, and TCK with due respect of the will of the Java Community Members with  regard to evolution. This means that a Maintenance Lead will automatically  be the Spec Lead for all significant revisions to their Specification going  forward but he or she will not have the exclusive right to decide when a significant revision will take place. That will be decided by the EC in response to a revision JSR that can be initiated by any Java Community Member (or Members).

		<h4>1.1.2 PROTECT THE INSTALLED BASE AND GUARD AGAINST FRAGMENTATION</h4>         
		Changes to the Java programming language, the Java virtual machine (JVM), the Java Native Interface (JNI), packages in the "java.*" space, or other packages delivered as part of J2SE, have the potential to seriously disrupt the installed base if carried out inconsistently across the Platform Editions. In order to protect the installed base, any such changes can only be accepted and carried out within a UJSR for J2SE.<br>
        
		&nbsp;<br>
		In order to guard against fragmentation, new Platform Edition Specifications  will not substantially duplicate existing Platform Editions or Profiles. <br>
    
    	<a name="1.1.3"></a>     
		<h4>1.1.3 PROFILES AND API SPECIFICATIONS TARGET CURRENT PLATFORM EDITIONS</h4>
            
		All new or revised Specifications must be compatible with the most recent versions of the targeted Platform Edition Specifications. In order to achieve this, all UJSRs to define new Profile Specifications, or revise existing Profile Specifications, must reference the latest version of the Platform Edition Specification they are based upon.<br>
    	
    	<a name="1.1.4"></a>     
		<h4>1.1.4 J2ME PROFILES AND J2ME BUILDING BLOCKS </h4>      
		<blockquote>
		<b>definition - J2ME Building Block (Building Block)</b>: A  subset of one or more APIs defined in the J2SE or J2EE Platform Edition Specifications.  The J2ME Platform Edition Specification is a collection of Building Blocks.  J2ME Profile Specifications can build up desired functionality by combining  new API sets with existing Building Blocks.<br> 
		</blockquote>
            
		J2ME Profiles will normally be based upon the existing Java virtual  machine and language Specifications. When such profiles also need to include  subsets of J2SE and/or J2EE functionality, they will reference J2ME Building  Blocks.<br>
            
		&nbsp;<br>
		Building Blocks are created and revised within the UJSR for the J2ME  Platform Specification. It is likely that different J2ME Profiles will require  different J2SE/J2EE subsets. For example, different categories of devices  may need different subsets of the "java.net" package. In order to accommodate  this, no fundamental restrictions are placed upon the number of times or ways in which J2SE/J2EE functionality can be packaged into J2ME Building Blocks.    <br>
            
		&nbsp;<br>
		Building Blocks can be proposed in a UJSR for the J2ME Specification.  However, it is recognized that the consumer and device marketplaces can change  very rapidly in comparison to the desktop and server marketplaces. The definition  of new Building Blocks (as well as the revision of existing blocks) may need  to be carried out very quickly in order for some J2ME Profiles to keep up  with changing market needs. In the interest of speed, J2ME Building Blocks  may also be defined and revised within the JCP Maintenance Cycle (see section  4.2) for the J2ME Specification. <br>
            
		&nbsp;<br>
		Expert Groups that need to quickly create or update a J2ME Building  Block should approach the Maintenance Lead for the J2ME Platform Edition Specification with their requests. The J2ME Maintenance Lead, after consultation with both the J2ME Expert Group and the Maintenance Lead(s) of the Platform Edition(s) the block is to be derived from, may propose the new Building Block as part of a maintenance update to the J2ME specification. Note that the EC can require any Building Block proposed as part of the Maintenance Cycle to be defined in a major revision to the J2ME Specification (see section 4.2.2).<br>
            
		&nbsp;<br>
		If the Maintenance Lead declines a Building Block request, the requesting  Expert Group has the options of initiating a UJSR for J2ME (which may be time consuming) or creating the needed APIs in any namespace not reserved for use by existing Platform Edition Specifications. <br>
            
		&nbsp;<br>
		In exceptional circumstances, the J2ME Specification may define J2ME  Building Blocks for use with special classes of devices that can only implement  subsets of the Java virtual machine or language Specifications. Such Building  Blocks can be defined and approved only within a UJSR for J2ME. They cannot  be defined using the Maintenance Cycle because proposals for Building Blocks  for these special classes of devices must be subject to the widest possible  review.<br>
          
		<h4>1.1.5 CONTINUED AVAILABILITY</h4>
		The technology that a JSR defines can be delivered as part of a profile or platform edition, it can be delivered stand-alone or both. Future versions of the technology may be integrated into a profile or a platform edition while previous versions were not. The submitter of a JSR will be required, via the JSR submission form, to indicate if it is the submitter's goal to deliver the JSR's RI and TCK as part of a profile or platform edition, stand-alone or both. When delivering the JSR's RI and TCK integrated into a profile or platform and not delivering these separately and where the RI and TCK of previous versions were available separately, the submitter must state the rationale. Also in this case the JSR Review (see section 1.2) will be 4 weeks instead of 14 days.<br>
     
		&nbsp;<br>
     	A JSR for a new version of an API that proposes to become part of a profile or platform edition and is considering discontinuing stand-alone availability where the previous JSR for this API did not indicate this plan, must make that proposal to discontinue stand-alone availability one version ahead.<br>
     
		<h4>1.1.6 PLATFORM INCLUSION</h4>
     	JSRs that want to be considered to be included in the definition of a platform edition or a profile should describe this intent in the JSR's submission. The final decision whether a specific JSR is included in a profile or a platform edition is made by the Spec Lead and Expert Group of that platform edition JSR or profile JSR, and confirmed by the EC ballots on those JSRs. If the platform edition or profile JSR turns down the request for inclusion then the JSR for the API will be required to deliver a stand-alone RI and TCK.<br>

		During JSR Review, EC members should review the JSR (with its  proposed Spec Lead and initial Expert Group), any comments and nominations  received, and cast their ballot to decide if the JSR should be approved. <br>

If a revised JSR is not received in that time, the original EC decision will stand and the JSR will be closed. If a revised JSR is received, the PMO will post it to the JSR Page, announce the revised JSR to the public, and send it to all EC members for a JSR Reconsideration  Ballot. If that ballot fails, the JSR will be closed.<br>

		&nbsp;<br>
		When a JSR is approved, the PMO will notify the identified Spec Lead to form the Expert Group. If the Member contributing the Spec Lead withdraws from the Community before the JSR is approved, the PMO will request the initial Expert Group to choose a replacement from among themselves who is willing to take on the duties defined in this document (including taking responsibility for the RI and TCK, working towards the estimated schedule given in the JSR, and assuming the position of Maintenance Lead as described in section 4). <br>
                        
		&nbsp;<br>
		There is no size limit on the Expert Group. The Spec Lead may  add additional Experts at any time provided the existing Expert Group is consulted first. New members may be added, for example, to increase diversity of opinion. A Spec Lead recruits new Experts by approaching other Members directly and working with them to identify an expert and bring him or her into the Expert Group. Individual experts can be brought into the Expert Group if they sign an IEPA.<br>
   
    	<a name="2.1.1"></a>                    
		<h4>2.1.1 FREEDOM OF WORKING STYLE</h4>
		Each Expert Group is free to define and follow whatever working  style it finds most productive and appropriate as long as it is compatible  with the JCP. Use of the Internet is encouraged. E-mail exchanges on mailing  lists established for the use by the Expert Group, along with conference calls and group meetings, have been used by past Expert Groups to discuss and resolve issues raised as the draft evolves. In-person group meetings are useful but they tend to slow down work considerably due to the need to coordinate schedules. <br>
    
    	<a name="2.1.2"></a>                      
		<h4>2.1.2 WITHDRAWAL OF AN EXPERT FROM THE EXPERT GROUP</h4>
		An Expert may withdraw from the Expert Group at any time. When  this happens, the Spec Lead may approach the Member who originally contributed  the Expert and work with them to find a replacement. If no replacement is  offered, the Spec Lead may recruit a replacement from another Member if desired.  If the departing Expert is the Spec Lead, the Expert Group should choose one of their members as the new Spec Lead provided he or she is willing to take on all of the responsibilities defined in this document.<br>
    
    	<a name="2.1.3"></a>                     
		<h4>2.1.3 UNCOOPERATIVE OR UNRESPONSIVE EXPERT GROUP MEMBERS</h4>
		There may be rare instances when members of the Expert Group  feel that one of their fellow Experts is not acting in ways that advance the work of the Expert Group. These concerns should be brought to the attention  of the Spec Lead and/or the EC as quickly as possible so they may be proactively  addressed and resolved. The Expert Group is expected to make a reasonable  effort to resolve any such issues among themselves. If a 2/3 majority of the members of the Expert Group find that a Spec Lead is being unresponsive, and the Spec Lead does not work to resolve the situation in a timely manner, the EC may direct the PMO to ask the Member who provided the Spec Lead to provide a replacement.<br>

		<div class="header4">2.2 WRITE THE FIRST DRAFT OF THE SPECIFICATION</div>
                        
		&nbsp;<br>
		The Expert Group should begin work by considering the requirements  set forth in the JSR, any contributed documents or technology descriptions,  comments received during JSR Review and, if this is a revision of an existing  Specification, the Change Log kept by the Maintenance Lead (see section 4).  Additional input can be obtained from discussions with other Members, industry  groups, software developers, end-users, and academics. The goal is to define  requirements and then write a draft suitable for review by the Community. <br>
                         
		&nbsp;<br>
		When the Expert Group decides that the first draft is ready  for review, the Specification Lead will send the draft, along with any additional  files required for review, to the PMO. The Specification Lead should also  suggest the length of the Community Review period if the Expert Group feels  it should go beyond the minimum 30 days.<br>

		The Spec Lead's company or organization is responsible for the Reference Implementation (RI) and Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) and its licensing under terms compatible with the licensing guidelines established  for use within the JCP. The Spec Lead will provide the EC with the terms under which the RI and TCK will be licensed no later than the start of Community  Review. EC members will provide feedback on the terms as an indication of  how the Community might react as a whole to the terms.<br>

		Refinement of the draft Specification begins when the PMO  posts it to JCP Web Site and announces the start of Community Review to all  of the Members. The goal of Community Review is to get the draft Specification  into a form suitable for Public Review as quickly as possible by uncovering  and correcting major problems with the draft.<br>

		During Community Review, EC members are strongly encouraged  to have one or more technical members of their organization carry out a review  of the draft in order to uncover possible overlap between the draft and other  Specification(s) or duplication of features or services already provided by other Specifications. EC members should inform the Expert Group of any such discoveries using the Member e-mail feedback address listed in the draft so they can be considered and responded to like all Member comments.<br>

If a revised draft is not received by the end of the 30 days, the original decision by the EC will stand and the JSR will be closed. If a revision is received, the PMO will forward it to the EC and initiate a Draft Specification Reconsideration Ballot.

		The Maintenance Lead is responsible for carrying  out maintenance on the Specification and dealing with errata by fielding requests for clarification, interpretation, and enhancements to the Specification from both Members and the public via an e-mail address listed in the Specification.  The ML will consider all requests and will decide how and if the Specification  should be updated in response. The ML will typically be the Spec Lead from  the Expert Group that developed the Specification. The ML is not required  to do all these tasks by himself or herself. The ML may find it very helpful to recruit members of the Expert Group that helped to develop the Specification to assist with the Maintenance duties.<br>

		The Maintenance Lead (and his or her host  company or organization) is expected to assume long term ownership of the  Specification, RI, and TCK with due respect of the will of the Java Community  Members with regard to evolution. This means that a Maintenance Lead will  automatically be the Spec Lead for all significant revisions to their Specification  going forward but he or she will not have the exclusive right to decide when  a significant revision will take place (see section 1.1.1).<br>

        If the ML decides to discontinue his or  her work for whatever reason (including discontinuing maintenance activities  or declining to take on the role of Spec Lead during a significant revision  initiated by a JSR) the ML should make a reasonable effort to locate another  Member who is willing to take on the task. If the ML fails to find a replacement,  the PMO will declare the Specification to be Dormant. No further maintenance  will be carried out on it until a new ML is identified and ownership of the  Specification, RI, and TCK is transferred to the new ML's organization (subject  to a successful Transfer ballot by the EC).<br>

		An Elected Seat that was vacated  by resignation will be filled for the remainder of its term by an election  ballot that will be held no later than two months after the resignation (unless  the resignation is less than three months before the next yearly election). <br>
                                                                        
		&nbsp;<br>
		The election ballot is carried out as follows:<br>
                                                                        
		<ul>
   		<li>Any Member may be nominated. 	</li>
        <li>The PMO will accept nominations  from the Community for a period of 14 days. </li>
        <li>Eligible Members may vote for  as many nominees as there are vacant Elected Seats over a 14-day voting period.</li>
        <li>The nominees who receive the  most votes will fill the vacant Elected Seats. </li>
        <li>Ties will be decided by drawing  lots. </li>
        </ul>
        
        All Members are eligible to vote  in an election ballot subject to the provision that if a Member has majority-ownership  of one or more other Members, then that group of Members will collectively  have 1 vote.<br>

        <li>EC balloting periods last 7 days except where noted in this document. 	</li>
       	<li>EC Members may cast two types of votes: "yes" and "no". Alternatively, a Member may explicitly abstain or, in the extreme and undesirable case, not vote at all. 	</li>
        <li>Only "yes" and "no" votes count  in determining the result of an EC ballot.</li>
        <li>Except where noted otherwise  in this document, EC ballots are approved if (a) a majority of the votes cast are "yes" votes, and (b) a minimum of 5 "yes" votes are cast. Ballots are otherwise rejected.</li>
        <li>"No" votes must be accompanied  by an explanation along with changes (if any) that are necessary to change  the vote to "yes". </li>
        <li>It is highly recommended that  abstentions be accompanied by comments. 	</li>
        <li>When a failed EC ballot results  in the closing of a JSR, at least 1 month must pass before the JSR can be  reinitiated. 	</li>
        <li>EC ballots to approve UJSRs for new Platform Edition Specifications or UJSRs for J2SE that propose changes to the Java language, are approved if (a) at least a two-thirds majority of the votes cast are "yes" votes, (b) a minimum of 5 "yes" votes are cast, and (c) Sun casts one of the "yes" votes. Ballots are otherwise rejected.</li>
        <li>EC ballots to override a first-level decision on a TCK challenge are approved if (a) at least a two-thirds majority of the votes cast are "yes" votes, and (b) a minimum of 5 "yes" votes are  cast. 	</li>
        <li>An item listed in an Item Exception Ballot will be deferred to the next JSR if at least one-third of the EC Members  cast "no" votes for that item. </li>
