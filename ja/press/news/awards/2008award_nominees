<strong> <a name=asf>Apache Software Foundation</a></strong<BR>
The ASF is a membership-based, nonprofit corporation that provides organizational, legal, and financial support for Java-based, open source software projects. Since the release of JCP 2.0, the ASF has actively participated in the JCP community. Individuals representing the ASF have served on numerous Expert Groups and helped implement JCP specifications through, for example, Apache Tomcat, Apache MyFaces, Webservices, and Portlets projects. The ASF has impacted the direction of the JCP program by consistently driving collaborative transparency while serving on the Java SE/EE EC.

<strong> <a name=intel>Intel</a></strong<BR>
Intel joined JCP in June 2002. Intel won open election to the ME Executive Committee (EC) in November 2003 and won re-election in 2004 and 2007.  Intel won an open election to the SE/EE Executive Committee in November 2004 and won re-election in 2005.  It has been an honor to be elected to represent the community on both Executive Committees. In the ECs, we have tried to help JCP to continue on its evolution towards more openness and transparency.  Intel has participated in 25 JSRs including JSR 270 Java SE 6, JSR 277 Java Modules, JSR 292 Supporting Dynamically Typed Languages, JSR 321 Trusted Computing, JSR 163 Location APIs, JSR 174 Monitoring and Management and many more.  Java is very important for our customers across a broad arrange of devices that we sell hardware for.  We have thousands of software engineers dedicated to ensuring our customers have first rate software that runs on our hardware.  Our participation in JCP has been an important part of that.

<strong><a name=rose>John Rose - Sun Microsystems, Inc.</a></strong><br>
<img src="/images/press/JohnRose100.jpg" hspace="12" vspace="6" align="left">
<BR />John R. Rose is a Senior Staff Engineer at Sun Microsystems, working on the OpenJDK project.  He has worked on Java(tm) technology at Sun since 1997, contributing widely to functionality and performance of the JDK stack.  The variety of his past projects includes inner classes, the initial port of HotSpot to SPARC, the Unsafe API, profile-driven JIT optimizations, JVM metadata tuning for object processing, scripting language design and implementation, and Pack200 application compression.  
As a longtime member of the HotSpot compiler group, John has greatly enjoyed participating in numerous JIT improvements that have helped make HotSpot a premier foundation for productive programming.  Before 1997 at Sun John worked on dynamic and hybrid languages, including Common Lisp, Scheme ("esh"), and dynamic bindings for C++, as well as compiler advanced development.  Still earlier he invented (with Guy Steele and Stephen Wolfram) the C* parallel language at Thinking Machines.  John has degrees in mathematics and English literature, and is a part-time high school teacher.  His blog is at <A HREF=http://blogs.sun.com/jrose/>http://blogs.sun.com/jrose/</a>.
<BR /><BR />
In the Java Community Process, John was co-lead (with Kumar Srinivasan) of the JSR 200 Expert Group, which successfully standardized and improved a hyper-compression algorithm.  (John invented it when he noticed that inner classes were not suitably compressed in JAR files.  An independent algorithm by EG member Bill Pugh contributed finishing touches.)  As a member of the JSR 241 EG, he contributed a semi-formal grammar to the Groovy scripting language.  
Most recently, as the JSR 292 lead, he has been working on specifying new support in the JVM standard for dynamic invocation and related facilities.   John is founder of the Da Vinci Machine Project, which includes the Reference Implementation for JSR 292, as well as other more experimental JVM features, all of which are intended to serve the needs of programming language implementors.

<strong><a name=bitterlich>Jean Yves Bitterlich, Sun Microsystems, Inc.</a></strong><br>
<img src="/images/press/jean-yves.bitterlich100.jpg" hspace="12" vspace="6" align="left">
<BR />
Jean-Yves has over 16 years experience in computer science, 10 of which on mobile phone platforms. He worked for research and innovation labs for various internet and telecommunication companies (Europe Online, DGA/SPOTI, Cap Gemini, Alcatel Mobile Phones, Siemens Mobile). He is a specialist in electronic payment systems, internet applications and telecommunication particularly from the mobile platform perspective and has co-founded a number of internet companies in Europe. At Siemens Mobile (later BenQ Mobile), he was software architect and team lead in the technology and innovation department. Since 2007, he works as a Senior Staff Engineer for Sun Microsystems in the technology management group. There he is also active in the W3C WebAPI WG as well as in the JCP program.
<BR /><BR />
He began participating in 2003 in the JCP program. Since that time, he has served as Specification Leader of the following JSR:
<UL>
<LI>JSR-229 Payment API for JavaME</LI>
<LI>JSR-259 Ad Hoc Networking API for JavaME</LI>
<LI>JSR-280 XML API for JavaME (co-spec with Nokia)</LI>
<LI>JSR-290 Java Language & XML User Interface Markup Integration API</LI>
</UL>
His basic approach to specification work is to start with a face to face meeting gathering drafts and visions setting thereby a list of requirements and use cases. Then, he would prepare a specification proposal based on the primary input. This first proposal should already be a consistent and fleshy document giving thereby a sound ground for further discussions and improvements. After that point, he mainly acts as an editor, coordinator and mediator bringing methodically the specification towards Final Release. When taking over specifications, he will in any cases respectfully take any past resolutions decided by the Expert Group and use them as a basis for finalizing the specification. In any cases, experience shows that an efficient work and satisfactory specification is reached by having prepared work and reaching consensus within the Expert Group.

Jean-Yves Bitterlich holds a Master of Science in computer science of the Oxford University as well as an engineering diploma of the Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Informatique pour l'Industrie et l'Entreprise (ENS-IIE).

<div class="header3">Most Innovative Java SE/EE JSR </DIV>
<BR>
<strong><a name=JSR294>JSR 294 - Improved Modularity Support in the Java Programming Language</a></strong><br>
JSR 294, "Improved Modularity Support in the Java Programming Language", aims to build on the success of packages for organizing large programs. JSR 294 introduces a 'module' as a unit which encapsulates multiple packages and allows sharing within its boundary. Accessibility from outside a 'module' to types inside a module is prevented at compile-time and run-time, thus providing a stronger foundation for deployment module systems than ever before.
<BR /><BR />
Of course, any Java language extension affects so many people that a perfect mix of readability, expressiveness, and consistency is required. Public response to 294 indicates that this mix has been achieved.

<div class="header3">Most Innovative Java ME JSR </DIV>
<BR>
<strong><a name=JSR290>JSR 290 - Java Language and XML User Interface Markup Integration</a></strong><br>
The Java Language & XML User Interface Markup Integration enables the creation of Java ME applications which combine the ease of authoring and graphical richness of Web UI technologies (such as XHTML Basic and SVG Tiny) with the power, flexibility, and breadth of the Java ME platform. This JSR opens new and innovative application areas, but also brings thereby a new but large and mature developer group to the Java ME platform: The web2.0 paradigm finally brought on mobile platforms will be particularly attractive due to the high number of feature oriented JSR (Camera, Location ...) allowing never-seen-before-and-amazing web2.0 applications. Jean-Yves Bitterlich, a senior staff engineer with Sun, is the specification lead for JSR-290.
