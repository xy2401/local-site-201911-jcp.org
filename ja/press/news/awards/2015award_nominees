						<div class="header1">The 13<sup><font size=-2>th</font></sup> JCP Annual Awards</div>
						<br>
						<p>
						The Java Community Process (JCP) program celebrates success. Members of the community nominate worthy participants, Spec Leads, and Java Specification Requests (JSRs) in order to cheer on the hard work and creativity that produces ground-breaking results for the community and industry in the Java Standard Edition (SE), Java Enterprise Edition (EE), or Java Micro Edition (ME) platforms.
						</p>
						<p>
						The community gets together every year at the JavaOne conference to applaud in person the winners the JCP Annual Awards.  This year we have four award categories: JCP Member/Participant of the Year, Outstanding Spec Lead, Most Significant JSR and Outstanding Adopt-a-JSR Participant. This year's unveiling will occur Monday evening, October 26, at the Annual JCP Community Party held at Hilton San Francisco Union Square.
						</p>
						<p>
						With great appreciation, now for the 13th year, the community recognizes the award nominees, listed below, with their nomination justifications.
						</p>

						&nbsp;<br>

<div class="header3">JCP Member/Participant of the Year</div>
<ul>

<LI><strong>Arjan Tijms (Zeef)</strong><br><br>
Arjan has been very active and provides great input into many expert groups including Java EE, 
JSF and Java EE Security. He also actively evangelizes Java EE. He is a great example of what we 
should expect from an individual in the JCP and deserves to be recognized.
<P>

<LI><strong>Adam Bien</strong><font color="#ff6633"> * Winner *</font><br><br>
Adam has consistently been part of key Java EE JSRs and consistently helps evangelize them in the community. 
In fact it would not be inaccurate to say that Adam is the highest profile evangelist for Java EE and the JCP. 
We should recognize Adam for his continued contributions.
<P>

<LI><strong>Ivar Grimstad</strong><br><br>
Ivar is a newcomer to the JCP but is already leaving his mark. Most notably as a member of the MVC 
specification he has been putting a lot of effort towards evangelizing it in addition to Java EE 
generally. We should encourage Ivar by recognizing his efforts.
<P>

<LI><strong>David Blevins (Tomitribe)</strong><br><br>
David has long been a strong supporter of the JCP in many Java EE related JSRs and continues his 
sincere hard work. He has also long been a strong advocate of Java EE in the community. 
We should recognize David for his contributions.
<P>

<LI><strong>Alex Soto</strong><br><br>
Alex has jumped into the JSON-P EG and in a few weeks, he became the most active (non Oracle) 
EG member for this JSR. He has also contributed part of the RI. Alex also does a lot of evangelism 
for 'his' JSR (JUGs, Devoxx, JavaOne, etc.).
<BR>
<BR>

</ul>		  
                
<div class="header3">Outstanding Spec Lead</div>
<ul>

<LI><strong>Anatole Tresch</strong><font color="#ff6633"> * Winner *</font><br><br>
Anatole has successfully seen the Money & Currency API, JSR 354, to completion. In doing so, he has 
collaborated extensively with his Expert Group members as well as the broader Java community by 
actively participating in many hack days and hackergartens around the word, and speaking at numerous 
developer conferences.
<P>

<LI><strong>Manfred Riem and Santiago Pericas-Geertsen</strong><br><br>
Despite the resource and scheduling challenges in Java EE 8 JSRs, Santiago and Manfred have made steady 
progress in the JSR 370, MVC 1.0 specification. They have also successfully engaged a number of folks from 
the community in the specification and RI.
<P>

<LI><strong>Antoine Sabot-Durand</strong><br><br>
Antoine has made solid and fast progress in the key CDI specification. He has an ambitious set of 
technical goals, runs an open community and operates extremely transparently. We should recognize Antoine 
as a measure of encouragement. 
<P>

<LI><strong>Greg Luck, Brian Oliver and Cameron Purdy</strong><br><br>
After an extended development process, Greg, Brian and Cameron successfully led JSR 107, JCACHE - 
Java Temporary Caching API, to completion and in the year since final release have five compatible implementations 
listed on JCP.org: https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/implementations/jsr107/index.html.
<BR>
<BR>

</ul>		  
                
<div class="header3">Most Significant JSR</div>
<ul>

<LI><strong><a href="/en/jsr/detail?id=365">JSR 365, Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) 2</a></strong><br><br>
CDI has long been a key enabler for Java EE and an important specification to the community. CDI 2 
is a very timely major investment in the specification. The CDI 2 specification is also moving steadily 
forward with its ambitious technical goals in a completely transparent fashion.
<P>

<LI><strong><a href="/en/jsr/detail?id=371">JSR 371, Model View Controller (MVC) 1.0</a></strong><br><br>
MVC is attempting to standardize a very mature space with strong non-standard competitors. The specification 
also needs to contend with the strong JSF ecosystem. So far the spec leads have done a great job of creating 
traction behind the specification and community excitement. MVC 1.0 give us an action based MVC based on REST, 
is so helpful and easy to learn. This is the end of JSF vs Spring MVC battle. Now we'll have two MVC frameworks, 
standards and both are great.
<P>

<LI><strong><a href="/en/jsr/detail?id=363">JSR 363, Units of Measurement API</a></strong><font color="#ff6633"> * Winner *</font><br><br>
It's the first JSR targeted to help with the Internet of Things, tackling sensor readings from edge devices and 
measurements in a standard way. Made to work on multiple environments, both Java ME 8 Embedded and Java SE makes 
it versatile across a large number of platforms and devices. JSR 363 is also the first and so far only JSR other 
than the core Java ME 8 JSR 361 (MEEP) utilizing optionality and modularity towards both a minimal footprint on 
very small devices and a Java 9 / Jigsaw compliant future.
<P>

<LI><strong><a href="/en/jsr/detail?id=354">JSR 354, Money and Currency API</a></strong><br><br>
As one of the few "domain driven" JSRs it helped solve problems like consistent monetary representation, 
rounding or formatting amounts in areas that had long been unresolved by the JDK. As well as exchange rate 
providers for the most important institutions making rates available or specialized FX providers that are now 
able to offer their rates and services in a standard compliant manner. Most importantly, JSR 354 seems the only 
JSR so far to offer a dual-platform RI for Java 8 and older versions at the same time when it went Final. 
<BR>
<BR>

</ul>		  

<div class="header3">Outstanding Adopt-a-JSR Participant</div>
<ul>

<LI><strong>Josh Juneau/Chicago JUG</strong><br><br>
Josh has done a great job engaging with Java EE 8 specifications and evangelizing the Adopt-a-JSR program itself. 
This is both within the Chicago JUG but also in the broader community. His efforts should be recognized as 
encouragement to him and others. 
<P>

<LI><strong>Olena Syrota and Oleg Tsal-Tsalko/Ukraine JUG</strong><br><br>
Contributing to JSR 367 test code-base (https://github.com/olegts/jsonb-spec), promoting 'Adopt a JSR' and JSON-B 
spec at JUG UA meetings (http://jug.ua/2015/04/json-binding/) and also at JavaDay Lviv conference 
(http://www.slideshare.net/olegtsaltsalko9/jsonb-spec).
<P>

<LI><strong>Anakar Parida/JUG Hyderabad</strong><br><br>
Anakar helped through Adopt-a-JSR with JSR 363 and related Units of Measurement projects. Especially UoM-Tools to 
import and sync Unit data like CLDR (in this case helping apply JSR 353/374 JSON-P he also adopted these 2 JSRs) 
or a Fitbit client for Units of Measurement utilizing the Agorava Project and with it CDI, JAX-RS, JSON and other 
standards like OAuth. 
<P>

<LI><strong>Rajmahendra Hegde/JUG Chennai</strong><font color="#ff6633"> * Winner *</font><br><br>
JUG Chennai been the first JUG from India to Adopt-a-JSR and have been contributing in the program as a Community over 
the last four years. They've been part of Adopt Java EE 7, Java Money and Currency and Unit of Measurement JSR. 
They also serve as Expert Group Members in JSR 354, Money and Currency API, JSR 363, Units of Measurement API and 
JSR 365, Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java 2.0. Apart from core JSR contribution, the Chennai JUG also 
participates in regular JSR review program, Hackergartens and contributed to many open source projects.
