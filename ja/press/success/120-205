Running late? Forget what your wife wanted at the store? Witness an 
accident take place on the way home? The practical uses of a mobile 
phones are endless for solving these and other kinds of daily 
problems. But voice communication is now only one of the services 
mobile phones provide.
<P>
A few years ago, the Short Message Service (SMS) protocol enabled 
text messaging of up to 160 characters between capable phones, and B4 
U could LOL, English MSGS had gr8ly changed 4ever :-D. Besides text, 
SMS also allowed for the sending of simple ringtones, calendars, 
clipart, and WAP, which stands for Wireless Application Protocol. 
Nowadays, over 20 billion text messages are sent every month.
<P>
But there's a new game in town: Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) 
permits users to heighten the impact of their messages by adding rich 
sounds, pictures, and video clips. With MMS, those audio-visual 
messages can be sent to any digital device on the network, such as 
another mobile phone or an email address.
<P>

<B>JSRs 120/205 Enable Wireless Messaging</b>
<P>
SMS and MMS are just the protocols, however. To get them to actually 
work on a Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> technology-capable mobile phone required the 
development of two Java Specification Requests through the Java 
Community Process<sup><font size="-2">SM</font></sup> (JCP<sup><font size="-2">SM</font></sup>) program: JSR 120 Wireless Messaging API 
(WMA) and JSR 205 WMA 2.0.
<P>
Jan Eichholz, senior architect Wireless Java at Siemens AG, served as 
Spec Lead for both JSRs. On the impetus for the projects, he says, 
"In the past there weren't any APIs available to access special 
features like SMS, MMS, and so on for mobile phones. With JSR 120, we 
added the features to send and receive SMSs and to send broadcast 
messages, which are very specific to the mobile phone." An ordinary 
phone can't send Cell Broadcast Service (CBS) messages, but with this 
Java technology, a mobile phone will be able to send messages to 
multiple devices simultaneously. "JSR 205 adds the capability of 
sending and receiving multimedia messages, which are being used 
extensively within the mobile phone space right now," says Eichholz.
<P>

<B>Reference Implementation</b>
<P>
As the first available implementation of a JSR, the Reference 
Implementation (RI) offers companies an example that they can license 
to use or adapt for commercial products. For JSR 205, the RI and 
Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) designer is Marquart Franz, who 
serves on the JCP Executive Committee (EC) for Java 2 Micro Edition<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> 
(J2ME<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup>). Franz is vice chair of the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) Game 
Services working group and principal engineer at Siemens Corporate 
Technology (CT). He has headed up the main Java activities of Siemens 
CT since 1996, and his research and development team supports various 
Siemens groups, including the Siemens Mobile Phones group, in terms 
of Java technology design, architecture, implementation, licensing, 
and standardization.
<P>
An early access version of the RI for JSR 205 is currently available 
to the Expert Group. "The design is made in a way that should be very 
easy to adapt the RI to a mobile phone. Our biggest goal is that we 
want to have the RI within Siemens phones as soon as possible, so we 
have to make the software in a way that it is usable for us," 
Eichholz explains.
<P>
However, Franz notes that the experts appear to be more interested in 
when they can acquire the final TCK, a toolkit that allows developers 
to test their own implementations for compliance with the 
specification of the JSR. While Siemens was responsible for the RI of 
JSR 205, experts are welcome to develop their own implementations 
whenever they wish. "Everyone on the Expert Group can just take the 
spec and implement it. When the JSR is finished and the TCK is 
available, the TCK can check the implementation real fast," says 
Franz.
<P>
But from start to finish, every aspect of the process takes time. 
Even after someone acquires the JSR, RI, and TCK, "they don't bring 
out a handset within a month or three or so," says Franz. "At the 
beginning, the JSR itself is interesting for handset vendors who want 
to port it to their handsets. The first thing you will see is 
companies enhancing their emulators, which will allow developers to 
start developing applications and testing them. Then they wait to see 
who will have the first device out there. The race starts after 
everything is finished."
<P>
Nicolas Lorain, product line manager for the Wireless Java Platform 
at Sun Microsystems, notes that all the licensees for JSR 120 
have licensed both RI and TCK so far. "We expect that the major 
handset manufacturers have been working on 'proprietary' 
implementations, while most Tier 2 handset manufacturers and 
third-party software providers -- which provide software 
implementations to some handset manufacturers -- have been relying to 
a certain extent on our RI source code."
<P>
Expectations for a broad implementation are high. Jan Eichholz says, 
"We expect nearly every mobile phone with Java technology this year 
or next year to implement JSR 120, since 120 is part of JSR 185, the 
umbrella JSR for JTWI -- Java Technology for the Wireless Industry."
<P>
With JSR 120 Wireless Messaging API, the race is on, and there's 
definitely a prize at the end. "WMA is the perfect example of 
value-added optional packages in the J2ME JCP process. It smoothly 
fit into the JTWI R1 release and was a significant value add to the 
J2ME Wireless Toolkit," says Gary Adams, the expert who designed the 
Reference Implementation for JSR 120. "SMS infrastructure is already 
deployed technology and developers are ready to tap into those 
capabilities from Java applications. It's a win win win situation for 
handset manufacturers, network operators, and content developers." 
Adams is currently a staff engineer in the Consumer and Mobile 
Systems Group (CMSG) in Software Products Group at Sun.
<P>

<B>Aplix Readies for Manufacturer Demand</b>
<P>
Gary Katz, director of corporate marketing for Aplix Corporation of 
America, agrees that including JSR 120 in JTWI ensures that most, if 
not all, manufacturers are going to want that capability. "When you 
add MMS -- which is becoming a very popular application that JSR 205 
delivers -- I think that should be attractive to developers. It's 
going to make Java technology an increasingly important and exciting 
platform for developers, and consumers benefit as a result because 
they get more functionality and better content on their mobile 
phones."
<P>
Aplix, a participant in the JSR 120/205 Expert Groups, sells the 
JBlend platform, a component, modular Java platform that is 
customized according to original equipment manufacturer (OEM) 
specifications. According to the Aplix Website, JBlend technology is 
"the most deployed Java execution environment for wireless devices in 
the world," licensed by technology leaders such as Alcatel, Casio, 
Hitachi, Kenwood, Kyocera, Matsushita (Panasonic), Mitsubishi, 
Motorola, NEC, SANYO, Sharp, Sony, Sony Ericsson and Toshiba <sup><font size="-2"><a href="#1">1</a></font></sup>.
<P>
JBlend includes the Aplix implementation of JSR 120 when a customer 
requests it. "Each customer gets their own optimized binary version 
of JBlend," says Michael Leone, chief technology officer of Aplix 
Corporation of America. "We look at the phone itself, the chip set, 
the operating system, and the customer's Java requirements -- for 
instance, whether 120 is needed. We simply deliver whatever customers 
ask for."
<P>
Aplix has served on twelve JCP Expert Groups, viewing such 
participation as essential for staying ahead of customer demand. As 
an example, Leone says, "Our involvement in the JSR 120 expert group 
enabled us to create our implementation in parallel with the 
specification being defined."
<P>
Because Aplix is so customer-driven, whatever their customers ask for 
in terms of functionality, they have to be prepared to offer. A 
customer may have three different phone models they're working on 
with various combinations of JSRs on them. "We have to quickly 
understand our customers' roadmaps and how JSRs fit into them, then 
deliver an implementation of JBlend that enables customers to ship 
their products on time. We finished our JSR 120 implementation late 
last year and made it available to customers shortly thereafter."
<P>
The company is doing a booming business, with more than 20 million 
shipments of JBlend in 58 models of mobile phones sold by 11 global 
operators. While those shipments do not include the JSR 120 
implementation, that will change shortly. Leone says, "Because 
operators are specifying this functionality, most of the customer 
roadmaps we've seen include at least one phone in development that 
supports 120. It's one of the most popular JSRs, and we've already 
delivered our JBlend implementation of 120 to several customers. 
You'll probably see products from some these customers in our three 
major markets, Japan, the US, and Europe, starting later in 2003 and 
continuing into 2004."
<P>

<B>Motorola Handset Coming Soon</b>
<P>
R. Seshadri is a principal staff engineer at Motorola who was a 
member of the Expert Group for JSR 120 and now serves on JSR 205's 
Expert Group. He says, "Motorola is very pleased with the quick 
evolution of JSR 205 from JSR 120. We feel it has the right set of 
APIs that will excite any Java technology developer to write midlets 
to deliver <sup><font size="-2">SM</font></sup>SMS and MMS. We believe this will spawn off many new rich 
media applications, which will exploit the delivered MMS content."
<P>
For the MotorolaV600 handset, Motorola's Personal Communications 
Sector (PCS) licensed a custom version of Aplix's JBlend platform 
that implements JSR 120. Retail models are supposed to be available 
very soon as an elegant package comprising advanced messaging 
features, a camera, "always-on" Internet connection, downloadable 
games and productivity applications, and other must-have features. <sup><font size="-2"><a href="#2">2</a></font></sup>
<P>
Motorola's iDEN i730 wireless handset model also supports JSR 120 and 
is designed to allow users to send messages via SMS and MMS. <sup><font size="-2"><a href="#3">3</a></font></sup>
<P>
Motorola has made the i.JV Reference Implementation for J2ME 
technology an integral part of the company's Innovative Convergence 
Platforms, giving OEMs a standard J2ME solution that can be rapidly 
configured and adjusted to meet 2.5G and 3G (second- and 
third-generation) handset market requirements. The i.JV RI includes 
the WMA optional package in order to make it possible to access 
wireless communication resources and use smart, connected Java 
applications. <sup><font size="-2"><a href="#4">4i</a></font></sup>
<P>

<B>Nokia Already in the Marketplace</B>
<P>
Nokia participated in the Expert Groups for JSR 120 and 205, and the 
company's investment of time and energy has proven fruitful. 
According to various Nokia Web pages and papers, JSR 120 is 
considered a core technology in their latest handsets. One of Nokia's 
white papers states that JSR 120 is a "key" Java API. The API makes 
it possible for multiple parties to play games, taking turns over SMS 
and/or MMS. Nokia is formalizing this strategy by implementing the 
Nokia Developer Software Platform (NDSP) for use by developers of 
content to be used in Nokia's Series 40 and Series 60 handsets. Among 
other things, NDSP 1.0 contains the JSR 120 Wireless Messaging API.<sup><font size="-2"><a href="#5">5</a></font></sup> 

<P>
Clearly, Nokia has wasted no time churning out compelling products 
that implement JSR 120. Nokia handsets that implement WMA are for 
sale right now, including a phone that is oriented horizontally for 
better keyboarding of messages and music management <sup><font size="-2"><a href="#6">6</a></font></sup>, a basic 
model available in Europe that features mobile chat and picture 
messaging <sup><font size="-2"><a href="#7">7</a></font></sup>, a handset that has a built-in video and still camera 
for creating combinations of picture, video, text or voice to send to 
a phone or PC via MMS <sup><font size="-2"><a href="#8">8</a></font></sup>, another that has a faceplate that flips up

<B>Sony Ericsson Makes Plans</b>
<P>
Hanz H&auml;ger is the Java Product Manager for Sony Ericsson and also the 
J2ME Executive Committee (EC) representative of Sony Ericsson. He 
reports, "We have implemented JSR 120 in our American version of T610 
that is called T616. We plan to have more JSR 120 supporting 
handsets." Although he would not comment on unannounced products, 
H&auml;ger says additional handsets supporting JSR 120 are forthcoming.
<P>
Sony Ericsson was part of the JSR 205 Expert Group. "I can only say 
that we are excited over this, and we also feel that this JSR has 
been successful in the sense that it has been going forward in a good 
pace," says H&auml;ger.
<P>

<B>How to Find it Out There</b>
<P>
It can be hard for a user to determine which phones implement the 
technology resulting from JSRs 120 and 205. Some manufacturers such 
as Nokia refer directly to WMA or JSR 120 on their specification Web 
pages. According to Leone, on handsets from other manufacturers, 
"it's more likely that a user would identify the technology by code 
phrases such as, 'Java technology-enabled messaging' or 
'JTWI-compliant phones.'"
<P>
Rich, rapid, fun communication via SMS or MMS is yours when you own a 
Java technology-enabled phone that implements JSRs 120/205. Got some 
time to kill before your next appointment? How about a quick game of 
Chess or Go? Oops, gotta take a raincheck -- my newborn niece's 
pictures are just coming in from Paris! CU L8TR ;-D.
