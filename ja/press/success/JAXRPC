Necessity may be the mother of invention, but unless a high 
technology "invention" conforms to standards, would-be adopters may 
embrace it only with reservations. Today's developers, businesses, 
and manufacturers are well aware that if an application programming 
interface (API) is not portable and interoperable, it is likely to 
lead down a proprietary dead end.

<B>The Fits and Starts of JAX-RPC
</B>
<P>
Graham Hamilton, chief technology officer of Java Software at Sun
Microsystems, is known as the brain that instigated JAX-RPC. By late
2000, several remote object access protocols, including CORBA (Common
Object Request Broker Architecture) and RMI (Remote Method
Invocation) had already been specified in the Java platform. However,
with the goal of making the Java language the optimal way of
programming XML (Extensible Markup Language), Hamilton felt it was
"really important" to add fully integrated Java platform support for
remote object access using SOAP/XML-based RPC.
<P>
Previous experiences with CORBA and RMI were enlightening. Hamilton
says, "With CORBA we learned the importance of closely following
standards and interoperating with other vendors. But with RMI we
learned the benefits of providing a simple Java programming model
where developers could do all their programming in Java and ignore
things like interface definition languages. So with JAX-RPC we
consciously tried to capture the best of both worlds."
<P>
Hamilton's group decided that JAX-RPC would support an RMI-like
mapping, enabling programmers to define all their methods in Java and
have them mapped to SOAP and WSDL (Web Services Description Language)
automatically. Another central goal for JAX-RPC was careful adherence
to the SOAP specifications, so JAX-RPC developers would always have
full interoperability with other languages and platforms.
<P>
Hamilton was excited about JAX-RPC, but projects were hopping at Java
Software. He complained to Rich Green, vice president of the Java
Platform, "We're out of our budget cycle and we're out of money!
Damn!" With remarkable foresight, Green agreed that JAX-RPC was a
priority anyway, and he gave the project a green light.
<P>
Others confirmed the market's interest in the technology. "As soon as
we started talking to JCP partners about JAX-RPC, we started getting
lots of positive interest and feedback. It became clear this was a
technology that was arriving at the right time," says Hamilton. Since
he didn't have time to lead the JAX-RPC expert group, Hamilton passed
the gavel to Rahul Sharma, one of Sun's senior Java architects.

BEA Systems, Systinet, and Oracle, as well as the open-source Apache 
community have no such reservations when it comes to implementing the 
new API specification, JSR 101 Java tm API for XML-based Remote 
Procedure Call (JAX-RPC), developed through the Java Community 
Process<sup><font size="-2">SM</font></sup> (JCP<sup><font size="-2">SM</font></sup>) Program. In fact, these organizations are supplanting their own 
proprietary solutions in favor of the JAX-RPC standard, thereby 
endorsing its efficacy.
<P>

<B>RAPID PROGRESS THROUGH JCP STANDARDS BODY</B>
<P>
JSR 101 JAX-RPC was developed through the Java Community Process 
standards body to help developers build Web Services that were 
assured of portability and interoperability. These two factors are 
critically important in guaranteeing that a Web Service such as a 
weather report or a stock quote works as flawlessly with one vendor's 
product as it does with a different vendor's product.
<P>
Spec lead for JSR 101 and a former senior Java architect at Sun, Rahul 
Sharma scheduled the Java Specification Request (JSR) to deliver a 
specification within a year. The expert group's active participation 
in face-to-face meetings, weekly conference calls, and email 
contributions allowed them to achieve their aggressive milestones 
while delivering a tightly scoped, high quality JSR.

                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>

<P>
Rahul says the team wanted to move quickly to ensure the portability 
and interoperability of Web Services through a standard Java API, 
since multiple non-standard APIs were emerging. Moreover, several 
other JSRs, including the latest specification for Java 2 Platform, 
Enterprise Edition (J2EE), depended on JSR 101's critical support for 
the development and deployment of Web Services.
<P>
Systinet and other companies were eager participants in the effort to 
develop JSR 101 JAX-RPC. "Systinet is a big believer in standard 
APIs, so as soon as the JCP started the effort to create a standard 
API for Java technology to access SOAP, we joined that expert group 
and started participating," says Anne Thomas Manes, an author and 
Systinet's former chief technology officer.
<P>

<B>BEA BRINGS OUT JAX-RPC IMPLEMENTATION IMMEDIATELY</B>
<P>
During the time expert group participants develop an API for the JCP, 
they may simultaneously develop their own implementation of the 
evolving spec. Through their active participation in the JSR 101 
expert group, BEA Systems was the first company to implement the 
JAX-RPC specification and pass the Technology Compatibility Kit 
(TCK). BEA had been working on their implementation for at least six 
months, in parallel with the expert group's work. When JAX-RPC 1.0 
was approved as final early in June 2002, BEA acted quickly. By the 
end of that month, BEA had delivered to developers and customers a 
production-quality implementation of that specification as part of 
their WebLogic Server 7.0.0.1 (WLS).
<P>
Before the 7.0.0.1 release, BEA had relied on a proprietary API for 
invoking Web Services, but that was replaced when the JAX-RPC API 
became available. John Kiger, director of Web Services, marketing, 
acknowledges the importance of standards, saying, "The value of 
providing a standard way to implement or deliver a technology is of 
tremendous importance to our customer, so it's part of the Web 
Services solution that BEA delivers, and part of the value 
proposition in our solution is our commitment to the open standards."

                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
<P>
Standards are important to developers as well. Don Ferguson manages 
BEA's Web Services development team for the Web Services 
implementation that ships with WLS. He says, "As a developer, when 
you learn one set of APIs, it's more useful for that knowledge to be 
based on a standard. You can go into a bookstore and buy books that 
tell you how to use the standard. If you ever need to go to a 
different company, your knowledge is portable because you're based on 
standard technology."

<P>
<B>APACHE ADDRESSES JAX-RPC AT USERS' REQUEST</B>
<P>
Like BEA, the Apache open-source community moved quickly to 
incorporate JAX-RPC. Glen Daniels, Macromedia's Web Services tech 
lead, is a developer on the Apache Axis project and a participant in 
the JSR 101 expert group.
<P>
Apache already had a couple of Web Services engines -- the original 
Apache SOAP code base and its reimplementation in the Apache Axis 
project. But as Apache monitored JSR 101 development, it was decided 
that Axis should be a JAX-RPC implementation. Daniels says, 
"Originally we thought Axis was not going to be JAX-RPC compliant in 
the first version because we wanted to release something soon. But as 
the schedule slipped for Axis and JAX-RPC got closer to final, we 
heard comments from our users that it would be really good if we were 
JAX-RPC compliant. So we decided to hold off on our 1.0 release until 
we could meet the JAX-RPC spec."
<P>
Daniels did not find the implementation work to be difficult. "We 
took a lot of the code already in Axis and wrapped it in the JAX-RPC 
interfaces. In general, it was pretty easy to do because a lot of the 
concepts in JAX-RPC are fairly universal across any Java Web Service 
implementation." Having passed the essential JAX-RPC TCK milestone, 
Apache released Axis 1.0 early in October.
<P>
JAX-RPC technology elicits a variety of responses from the Apache 
community. According to Daniels, those who use it are pleased to have 
an agreed-upon API that everybody in the J2EE world who deals with 
Web Services can rely on. "It's nice to have a standard API for some 
things, so if you don't need any of those particular tweaky features 
that individual implementations have, you can write your framework 
one time and be able to use it on top of a number of different 
vendors' products," he says. Implementers at Apache are excited to be 
able to help define the technology, especially given the new update 
to JCP version 2.5, which makes enhancements to give open-source 
equal standing in the community, including no-cost access to TCKs for 
non-profits and the possibility of open-source licensing and 
independent implementations of a specification.
<P>
"As we move forward, Apache is going to enable all these great 
developers to get more input into the JCP in a way they might not 
have before, and that's a great thing," Daniels says. In general, the 
message from Apache is that "innovation is a really good thing, and 
standards overlaid on top of that make it possible to scale in a way 
that makes sense."
<P>

<B>SYSTINET SHELVES PROPRIETARY API TO IMPLEMENT JAX-RPC</B>
<P>
Like other organizations, Systinet had implemented a proprietary API 
to enable Web Services, but they are glad they can rely on a standard 
now. Anne Thomas Manes says, "We decided it was really not very 
helpful to have a proprietary API. Systinet is basically 
rearchitecting the product around JAX-RPC, and the proprietary API is 
going to go away."
<P>
This decisive move to embrace a new standard is certain to please 
Systinet customers -- developers, businesses, independent software 
vendors (ISVs), and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). 
Sometimes it is necessary to use multiple SOAP stacks, and JAX-RPC 
provides a common API that works with any SOAP stack. "I view JAX-RPC 
as the standard Java language binding for SOAP. One key feature that 
it provides is a standard mapping between Java data types and XML 
Schema data types," says Thomas Manes. "A common API that works 
across all products is a wonderful thing for the developer. They only 
have to learn one API and not all the differences among the various 
products out there."

<P>
Business customers that use Systinet's solutions also appreciate the 
fact that the Systinet product supports standards. "They know their 
developers are going to be able to use them without going through a 
long learning curve to figure it out. And if they have to use 
multiple implementations for whatever reason, it's always nice to 
have ones that conform to the standard," Thomas Manes says.
<P>
Thomas Manes perceives an even greater advantage for the ISVs and 
OEMs who embed Systinet's technology. "They are trying to add SOAP 
support to their product, and they use our technology to add that 
SOAP support." They don't want to have to require their customers to 
buy Systinet tools in order to use their product. JAX-RPC is 
sufficient to use the product, "and that's a huge win for them," she 
says.
<P>
Systinet has preliminary support for JAX-RPC available today, based 
on the 0.7 release of the specification. Systinet's SOAP 
implementation for Java technology, WASP 4.0 (Web Applications and 
Services Platform) acts as middleware to allow one application to 
talk to another. The JAX-RPC API provides a standard interface for 
applications to talk to SOAP services, so JAX-RPC is the client API 
used to call one of Systinet's services.
<P>
Of the three interface APIs -- stub, service, and call -- that were 
defined as part of the JAX-RPC specification, Systinet has 
implemented support of the call interface for dynamic invocation, 
with support of the service interface for dynamic proxy soon to 
follow. Soon, support is expected for the stub interface, a Web 
Services description (WSDL) compiled into a routine that interfaces 
with a client. Once the entire JAX-RPC API has been implemented, 
Systinet's product will submit to compatibility testing under the 
TCK, which Systinet is in the process of licensing from Sun 
Microsystems.
<P>

<B>ORACLE OPTS FOR CLEAN JAX-RPC IMPLEMENTATION</B>
<P>
Unlike BEA, Apache, and Systinet, Oracle seems to be taking a more 
measured approach to implementing JAX-RPC. Their current Web Services 
product uses a non-standard API. Don Deutsch, Oracle's vice president 
for standards strategy and architecture, explains, "Because there was 
no standard solution, we, like everyone else, had to roll our own, 
and that's one reason we're enthusiastic about JAX-RPC. We see this 
as a fundamental building block for Web Services, and prior to 
JAX-RPC there really was not a standard API in any language for doing 
Web Services."

Senior engineer Neal Wyse, of Oracle, adds, "Having a standards-based 
approach to the APIs and functionality as opposed to what everybody 
else rolls on their own helps provide a common set of features and 
functionality that everyone implements. For customers, they don't 
have to worry about whether Oracle's solution is different from 
Sun's, or different from IBM's." Having core functionality defined in 
the standards allows implementers to implement that core but also 
focus on where Oracle, for example, adds value. "This makes the 
process a lot cleaner," says Wyse.

<P>
Oracle plans to implement JAX-RPC in the next major release of 
Oracle's Application Server. "Having been involved with the design of 
the specification, we're glad to see the fruit of our efforts," Wyse 
says.

<B>RIGOROUS TCK ENSURES COMPATIBILITY</B>
<P>
Bringing Web Services and J2EE technology standards together is an 
important step for extending the power of the J2EE platform into a 
Web Services environment. And JAX-RPC helps make that happen in a way 
that ensures portability and interoperability for all implementations 
that pass the compatibility testing. The Technology Compatibility Kit 
is the strong arm that makes sure implementations of the JAX-RPC API 
will work in a standard fashion.
<P>
Implementations that support JAX-RPC have to pass the TCK to claim 
compatibility with a specific standard set of APIs. The Sun Reference 
Implementation, BEA implementation into the WebLogic Server 7.0.0.1 
(WLS), Apache Axis open source implementation, and Systinet WASP 4.0 
must pass the compatibility test before they can achieve certified 
compatibility.
<P>
Don Ferguson of BEA is complimentary of the rigorous nature of the 
TCK. "We found the quality of the TCK to be high, and I think that's 
important for anyone who is implementing the technology. You want to 
have a good compatibility test. It proved to be very effective at 
finding areas where the specification had been somewhat ambiguous and 
showing how the implementation needed to be done," he says. "We were 
very fast in getting WebLogic Server 7.0.0.1 certified, passing the 
TCK, working with Sun to either fix product problems or to test 
problems, and getting a version out there for production use."
<P>
The TCK process was interesting for Apache on several fronts. Glen 
Daniels says, "This was the test case for the new licensing agreement 
for the TCK, so we were kind of the testing ground for that. Barring 
a few fits and starts in the beginning in terms of getting 
communication hooked up with the right people, it was just a great 
process." For Daniels, what constitutes a great process is the fact 
that Apache disputed several items in the TCK, and those items were 
successfully resolved.
<P>

<B>A GREAT STEP FORWARD</B>
<P>
Graham Hamilton, the original Sun Microsystems brain behind JAX-RPC, 
is pleased with JSR 101 and its handling by spec lead Rahul Sharma. 
"In watching the evolution of JAX-RPC I've been constantly impressed 
by Rahul's skill in balancing the needs and input of different expert 
group participants and thereby creating a single standard that can be 
used by the whole Java community. I think the final JAX-RPC 
specification is a great piece of technology that more than meets our 
original hopes for an easy-to-use Java technology integration of SOAP 
RPC," he says.

                    </tr>
                  </table>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>

<P>
"The JAX-RPC API has shown itself to be a well-conceived set of 
functions for doing standard synchronous invocation of Web Services," 
agrees Don Ferguson. Based on his reading of messages posted on the 
WebLogic developers newsgroups for Web Services, he concludes that 
customers are able to do what they need to do with the JAX-RPC API 
suite.
<P>
"JAX-RPC is a great step forward," says Glen Daniels. "There are 
further places to go, but JAX-RPC is a first very tangible step in 
getting Web Services into the consciousness of the Java community. In 
general we did a pretty good job getting the spec out there. It's not 
perfect and it doesn't cover every single base, but it's a very good 
start."
<P>
Plans are underway for the next version to give developers more of 
what they want. The current JAX-RPC API already helps Java developers 
with development of portable and interoperable Web Services, 
increased productivity, support for open standards (XML, SOAP, WSDL, 
XML Schema), and multiple implementations. Rahul Sharma says, "With 
continued feedback and support from a strong Java developer 
community, we aim to evolve the JAX-RPC API incrementally to address 
the evolving Web Services standards and technologies. Such support 
offered in a collaborative open process is what makes Java standards 
successful."
