<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=6>JSR-310 Date and Time API Guide</FONT></P>
<H2>NOTE: The Java Time API defined by JSR 310 is provided as part of
JDK-8. The specification is the Javadocs for the java.time packages.
This guide introduces the API for the purpose of review.</H2>
<H2>1. Introduction</H2>
<P>Many Java applications require logic to store and manipulate dates
and times. At present, Java SE provides a number of disparate APIs
for this purpose, including Date, Calendar, SQL Date/Time/Timestamp
and XML Duration/XMLGregorianCalendar. JSR improves on these APIs and
covers many additional use cases needed by developers.</P>
<P>As an example, Java developers currently have no standard Java SE
class to represent the concept of a date without a time, a time
without a date or a duration. The result of these missing features
has been widespread abuse of the facilities which are provided, such
as using the Date or Calendar class with the time set to midnight to
represent a date without a time. Such an approach is very error-prone
- there are certain time zones where midnight does not exist once a
year due to the daylight saving time cutover!</P>
<P>JSR-310 tackles this by providing a comprehensive set of date and
time classes suitable for Java SE today. The API includes:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Date and Time</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Date without Time</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time without Date</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Offset from UTC</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time Zone</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Durations</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Periods</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Formatting and Parsing</P>
	<LI><P>A selection of calendar systems</P>
</OL>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>This document is an introduction to the full API, which
consists of the Javadoc. The Javadoc specification is available via
the JCP <A href="/en/jsr/detail.id.310.html">JSR 310 Date
and Time API </A>. The early access reference implementation included
in <A HREF="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk8/">JDK 8</A> is
available for <A HREF="https://jdk8.java.net/download.html">download</A>.
Additional information related to JSR 310 can be found at the
<A HREF="http://threeten.github.io/">Threeten Project</A> on GitHub.
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This draft guide is released to gain
feedback. Since it is a draft, readers are advised to take care when
referencing it.</P>
<HR>
<H2>2. Date and Time terminology</H2>
<P>The domain of dates, times and other temporal concepts is large
and complex - much more complex than is often apparent. A key aim of
the JSR is to allow the API to explain this complexity simply by the
way that the features are exposed. In this way, the user of the API
is guided to make the correct choice, minimising the potential for
bugs.</P>
<P>Part of this process is determining and using a consistent
terminology. For this purpose, JSR-310 is building upon the excellent
work of the ISO-8601 standard. However, we have changed a few terms,
thus the entire terminology is defined here for clarity:</P>
<DL>
<DT>Time line</DT>
<DD>The single line or axis of time from the past to the future.</DD>
<DT>Instant</DT>
<DD>A single instantaneous point on the time line.</DD>
<DT>Duration</DT>
<DD>A quantity of time equal to the directed difference between any
two instants on the time line.</DD>
<DT>Epoch</DT>
<DD>A known, well-defined, instant that can be used as a reference
point to measure other instants from.</DD>
<DT>Time-scale</DT>
<DD>A system of assigning meaningful values to instants in relation to
a known epoch.</DD>
<DT>Continuous time-scale</DT>
<DD>A time-scale fundamentally based on a single incrementing number.
This is usually defined as a duration relative to an epoch.</DD>
<DT>International Atomic Time (TAI)</DT>
<DD>The primary continuous time-scale intended for scientific and
technical purposes, defined by international standard. It is agreed
internationally based on atomic clocks and is completely continuous.
All days have exactly 86400 seconds. The time-scale is measured in
terms of the SI second unit.</DD>
<DT>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</DT>
<DD>The standard time-scale intended for civil purposes, defined by
international standard. It follows TAI except for the insertion or
removal of an integral number of leap seconds which are intended to
keep UTC closer to the real and variable length of a solar day. Most
days have 86400 seconds, but some have 86399 or 86401 seconds. The
time-scale is measured in terms of the SI second unit.</DD>
<DT>Simplified &quot;UTC&quot;</DT>
<DD>A time-scale that is not defined by international standard, but is
widely implemented by computer systems. This time-scale treats all
days as having exactly 86400 seconds while staying in tune with UTC.
This definition is, of course, not actually possible, however it is a
suitable approximation for most normal computing use cases.</DD>
<DD>The time-scale is typically implemented by relying on the fact
that clocks in most computers are not accurate and the functions that
tell the time are loosely specified. One approach is to slow time
down around a leap second, a second is to make time go back one
second, while another is to make the system hang for a second.
<DT>Coordinated Universal Time with Smoothed Leap Seconds (UTC-SLS)</DT>
<DD>An <A HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/%7Emgk25/time/utc-sls/draft-kuhn-leapsecond-00.txt">internet
draft</A> that defines a way to map UTC (with leap seconds) to
simplified &quot;UTC&quot; (without leap seconds). The approach
smooths leap seconds over the last 1000 seconds of the day. This
provides an exact mapping between a highly accurate clock and the
form of time that is useful to computer programmers. This approach,
like any that changes the meaning of the second, is referred to as
rubber seconds.</DD>
<DT>Rubber seconds</DT>
<DD>A second that is slightly longer (or shorter) than the SI unit of
a second. This can be used to hide the existence of a leap second.</DD>
<DT>Java time-scale</DT>
<DD>A simple time-scale designed to provide the time-of-day to an
accuracy suitable for most Java applications. The Java Time scale is
described fully in java.time.Instant, summarized here as:
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">midday will always be exactly as
	defined by the agreed international civil time</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">other times during the day will be
	broadly in line with agreed international civil time</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the day will be divided into
	exactly 86400 subdivisions, referred to as &quot;seconds&quot;</P>
	<LI><P>the Java &quot;second&quot; may differ from an SI second</P>
</OL>
</DD>
<DD>The UTC-SLS draft standard is one way to implement the JSR-310
time-scale if the application has access to an accurate underlying
clock.</DD>
<DT>Chronology</DT>
<DD>A way of defining time that is meaningful to humans and used in
everyday life, also known as a calendar system. It uses individual
fields, such as year, month, day, hour minute and second. There are
many chronologies, each defining fields in different ways.</DD>
<DT>Period</DT>
<DD>A quantity of time, expressed in terms of the fields of a
particular calendar system, such as &quot;five years.&quot;</DD>
<DT>Zone offset</DT>
<DD>A period, usually between +14 and -12 hours, that a given location
differs from UTC at any given instant. The offset used for a
particular location is controlled by government. The value used
originally aimed to ensure that the calendar system time of midday
(12:00) was equivalent to the solar midday. Today, the offset is
influenced by many other factors.</DD>
<DT>Daylight Saving Time (DST)</DT>
<DD>A change to the zone offset that typically occurs each summer. The
standard approach is to move clocks forward in the Spring and back in
the Autumn/Fall. The two periods are generally known as Summer and
Winter time. Whether a given location does this, and on what dates is
controlled by local authorities.</DD>
<DT>Gap and Overlap</DT>
<DD>A gap occurs in the local time-line when clocks move forwards,
typically in Spring due to DST. An overlap occurs in the local
time-line when clocks move back, typically in Autumn/Fall due to DST.</DD>
<DT>Time zone</DT>
<DD>An area of the planet that uses the same zone offset and observes
the same rules for changing it due to daylight savings time. A time
zone is controlled by government. Some countries have multiple time
zones, others share a time zone with their neighbours.</DD>
<DT>Time zone rules</DT>
<DD>A set of rules, for each time zone, that determine how the zone
offset varies. A simple set of rules consist solely of a fixed, year
round, offset. More complex rules include annual daylight savings
changes, historical data and predicted future changes. There are
multiple sources of time zone rule data.</DD>
<DT>Local date/time</DT>
<DD>A date or time defined solely using calendar system fields. A
local date or time does not represent a fixed instant, or range of
instants. For example the local date of 3rd December 2009 will start
at one instant in Australia, a later instant in the UK, and an even
later instant in the USA. In all cases however, the same local date
is referred to.</DD>
<DT>Offset date/time</DT>
<DD>A date or time defined using calendar system fields and a zone
offset. Unlike a local date or time, an offset date or time can be
converted to and from an instant. For example the local date of 3rd
December 2009 refers to a specific instant once the zone offset of 1
hour ahead of UTC is specified.</DD>
<DT>Zoned date-time</DT>
<DD>A date-time defined using calendar system fields, zone offset and
time zone. As with an offset date or time, a zoned date-time can be
converted to and from an instant. In addition, the presence of a time
zone allows accurate calculations of related date-times, such as
adding 6 months (which may cause the zone offset to alter).</DD>
</DL>
<HR>
<H2>3. Design Goals</H2>
<P>Immutable</P>
<P>The JSR-310 classes should be immutable wherever possible.
Experience over time has shown that APIs at this level should consist
of simple immutable objects. These are simple to use, can be easily
shared, are inherently thread-safe, friendly to the garbage collector
and tend to have fewer bugs due to the limited state-space.</P>
<P>Fluent API</P>
<P>The API strives to be fluent within the standard patterns of Java
SE. A fluent API has methods that are easy to read and understand,
specifically when chained together. The key goal here is to simplify
the use and enhance the readability of the API.</P>
<P>Clear, explicit and expected</P>
<P>Each method in the API should be well-defined and clear in what it
does. This is not just a question of good Javadoc, but also of
ensuring that the method can be called in isolation successfully and
meaningfully.</P>
<P>Extensible</P>
<P>The API should be extensible in well defined ways by application
developers, not just JSR authors. The reasoning is simple - there are
just far too many weird and wonderful ways to manipulate time. A JSR
cannot capture all of them, but an extensible JSR design can allow
for them to be added as required by application developers or open
source projects.</P>

<P>We classify dates and times into two basic use cases -
machine-scale and human-scale.</P>
<H3>4.1 Machine-scale time</H3>
<P>Machine-scale time represents the passage of time using a single,
continually incrementing number. The rules that determine how the
scale is measured and communicated are typically defined by
international scientific standards organizations.</P>
<P>Two key classes are defined to represent machine-scale time:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instant - An instant on the
	time-line</P>
	<LI><P>Duration - A duration of time</P>
</OL>
<P>These classes use nanosecond precision. The classes have
sufficient accuracy to represent any nanosecond instant within the
current age of the universe. The epoch used is 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z
(midnight at the start of 1 January 1970 UTC), as per the current
Java SE date and time classes.</P>
<H3>4.2 Human-scale time</H3>
<P>Human-scale time represents the passage of time using a number of
named fields, such as year, month, day, hour, minute and second. The
rules that determine how the fields work together are defined in a
calendar system.</P>
<P>The design adopted splits the classes into value types and
fields/units. Simple applications will not need to be concerned with
fields and units.</P>
<H4>4.2.1 Value types</H4>
<P>The high level API contains the following key classes:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">LocalDate - A date, with no time
	nor zone-offset</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">LocalTime - A time, with no date
	nor zone-offset</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">LocalDateTime - A date-time, with no zone-offset</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">OffsetTime - A time and
	zone-offset, with no date</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">OffsetDateTime - A date-time and
	zone-offset</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">ZonedDateTime - A date-time,
	zone-offset and time-zone</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">ZoneOffset - An offset from the
	time in UTC/GMT</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">ZoneId - A time-zone identifier,
	used to find the underlying rules</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P>Each of these date-time classes represent time in the ISO calendar
system, defined by ISO-8601. This is also known as the proleptic
Gregorian calendar system, and is the de facto civil calendar system
used today in the vast majority of the world.</P>
<P>Each date-time field can be represented as a value, which is
expressed as a long. Some fields also have an enum defined for code
clarity and safety. These include month, day of week, am/pm and
quarter.</P>
<P>Although there are lots of classes and each class has lots of
methods, the &quot;conceptual weight&quot; of the API is greatly
reduced through consistent use of method name prefixes. Some of these
prefixes differ from JavaBean conventions because the classes are
immutable:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">get - Gets the specified value</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">with - Returns a copy of the
	object with the specified value changed</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">plus/minus - Returns a copy of the
	object with the specified value added/subtracted</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">multipliedBy/dividedBy/negated -
	Returns a copy of the object with the specified value
	multiplied/divided/negated</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">to - Converts the object to
	another related type</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">at - Returns a new object
	consisting of this date-time at the specified argument, acting as
	the builder pattern</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">of - Factory methods that don't
	involve data conversion</P>
	<LI><P>from - Factory methods that do involve data conversion</P>
</OL>
<P>Applications will also commonly use the TemporalAdjuster interface
and the standard implementations provided in TemporalAdjusters. These
pre-packaged common manipulation functions like ���next Wednesday���
or the ���last day of the month���. They are especially valuable in
capturing the intent of business logic.</P>
<H4>4.2.2 Fields and units</H4>
<P>Dates and times are formed from fields and units.</P>
<P>A unit is a measurable unit of time, such as a year, month or
hour. The set of known units can be extended by applications.</P>
<P>A field is used to express part of a larger date-time, such as
year, month-of-year or second-of-minute. The set of known fields can
also be extended by applications.</P>
<P>Fields and units work together with the abstractions Temporal and
TemporalAccessor provide access to date-time classes in a generic
manner.</P>
<H4><A NAME="h.30u7w3fsdpb9"></A>4.2.3 Chronologies</H4>
<P>Other calendar systems are supported with a separate
calendar-neutral API. This is focused on the Chronology and
ChronoLocalDate classes. These do not have the same breadth or depth
as the main ISO calendar system API.</P>
<P>It is recommended that applications use the classes in the main
API for all communication between systems and subsystems, including
public APIs, storage to a database and communication across the
network. The calendar neutral API should be used primarily for user
localization.</P>
<H3>4.3 Machine/Human comparison</H3>
<P>The division in the API between machine-scale and human-scale is
deliberate and necessary, as the two time-scales represent different
ways of looking at time.</P>
<P>The machine-scale approach is very time-line focused. For example,
Instant simply represents an instant on the time-line. The only
meaningful operations on the class are to check whether the instant
is before or after another instant. These classes will be of most use
for recording event timestamps and logging.</P>
<P>The human-scale approach is very focused on what the time means to
a human, through the use of the fields. In addition to getting and
setting the field values, methods are provided to perform
mathematical operations, such as adding three days to a date. These
classes will be of most use in business logic, such as representing
the departure time of a train or a customer's birthday.</P>
<H3>4.4 Calendar/Joda-Time comparison</H3>
<P>The design adopted is notably different to the Java SE Calendar
API and the Joda-Time API.</P>
<P>The Java SE Calendar API has a single base class that represents
both the date-time and the calendar system. Different calendar
systems are implemented as subclasses. This design is flawed as
calendar systems are too different to be properly treated as
subclasses.</P>
<P>The Joda-Time API has simple date-time classes with a plug-in
calendar system (chronology). This design, while better than
Calendar, is also flawed because each method on the API is unable to
properly define its result. For example, the getMonthOfYear() method
normally returns a value from 1 to 12, however if the Coptic calendar
system has been &quot;plugged in&quot; then the method will return
results from 1 to 13.</P>
<P>The JSR-310 design ensures that each method on the core API is
able to fully define its input and output by focusing the entire
class on a single calendar system. Instead, users with advanced
requirements have to study the API a little more closely and use the
low-level temporal classes.</P>
<HR>
<H2>5. Feedback</H2>
<P>The ThreeTen project and JSR-310 needs feedback! We need reviewers
to read the guide and Javadoc, and where possible, try out the code
(in the JDK 8 Early Access Releases).</P>
<P>Specifically, we need to know if</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">whether there are key use cases
	that are missing (or you can't find)</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">specific method names are unclear</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the API is clear, unclear or about
	right</P>
	<LI><P>anything else that is an issue</P>
</OL>
<P>Feedback and comments on the specification review drafts should be sent to
    <a HREF="mailto:threeten-develop@lists.sourceforge.net">
        threeten-develop@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.</P>
<P>Feedback is public information on a trust and respect basis for
the public good and may be used by anyone in any way forever.</P>
