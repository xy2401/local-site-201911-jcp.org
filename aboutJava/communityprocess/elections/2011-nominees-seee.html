<td>
<! -- Qualifications -->
<p>Ericsson has a long history with standardization within many different standardization forums such as 3GPP, IEE etc. Within JCP Ericsson is engaged in all aspects of Java standardization and especially in defining the next version of the Java EE platform. Ericsson has participated in over 40 JSRs, and has been the spec lead for several (e.g. JSR-281, JSR-319).
 
<p>Ericsson is also contributing in other ways, such as releasing our SIP-servlet container to the open source community in order to provide enhanced communication capabilities closely associated with Java EE. Java plays an increasing role in the emerging all IP communication networks and for us Java EE servers and SIP servlets are a logical choice to enable quick development of new services within the telecommunication industry.

<p>Ericsson nominates Magnus L�nnroth. He is specialized in middleware/internet and database technologies with broad knowledge of relevant software topics. He is a strong supporter of open technologies and was a charter member of the World Wide Web Consortium's Mobile Web Initiative (W3C MWI) and worked in the Steering Council between May 2005 and Dec 2009. Magus has pioneered database-driven web technology, server-side Java, and Java/CORBA integration and has led the implementation of several very large Java-based mobile data services. 

<p>Now Ericsson seeks your support for our nomination of Magnus L�nnroth in order to offer technology leadership and strong support to evolve the JCP and to promote Java as the technology of choice for the telecom industry. We will work for openness and transparency within the Java standardization and continue our contributions within the standardization and open source communities.

Steve Harris is SVP of products at CloudBees. He acted as Oracle?s point person and development lead on Java server technology and standards activities for most of his 13 years at Oracle prior to joining CloudBees. At Oracle, he was responsible for the Java EE platform and commercial products based on it. In that capacity, he participated with the Java community and with other vendors from the earliest days of the JCP. This experience gives him a unique perspective on the challenges that face the Java community today and how best to work within the EC to address those challenges with the community.

Twitter is increasingly relying on the JVM as its runtime, with most of new software being written in Java or Scala. We are solving challenging design problems at our scale and are developing libraries for scalable IO, monitoring, and management. We started diversifying in programming languages; in addition to Java and Scala, we are beginning to write systems in Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and Clojure on JVM. We have a strong record of community involvement, much of our software is open sourced.

      <p>ABOUT THE JAVA COMMUNITY PROCESS (JCP) EXECUTIVE COMMITTEES </p>
      <p>The JCP has two Executive Committees (EC) -
Standard/Enterprise &amp; Micro
Edition, each targets different markets for the Java Platform. Voting
Members on each EC serve 3-year terms; there are 10 Ratified Seats, 5
Elected Seats, and the permanent seat held by Sun Microsystems, Inc.
The
3-year terms are staggered so that 5 of the 15 seats are normally up
for
ratification/election each year. </p>
      <p>The EC members guide the evolution of the Java technologies.
The EC
represents a cross-section of both major stakeholders and other members
of the Java Community. Duties are: select JSRs for development, approve
draft Specifications for Public Review, approve Final Specifications,
review TCK appeals, approve Maintenance revisions and possibly defer
some features to a new JSR, approve transfer of maintenance duties
between members and provide guidance to the Program Management Office
(PMO). For more information on the EC, see the Executive Committee Info
page <a href="/en/participation/committee">http://jcp.org/en/participation/committee</a>.
