<p>
Credit Suisse is a global bank headquartered in Zurich, serving clients in private banking, wealth management, 
and investment banking. The bank has 530 offices and 22 booking centers located in over 50 countries. From the 
46000 employees, around 10000 IT specialists work in application and infrastructure IT departments, in roles 
ranging from architecture, development, and operations.
<p>
In 2010, Credit Suisse was elected in the JCP Executive Committee to be the first member to represent the 
customers of Java technology. Customers want strong and open standards to secure their investments and to choose 
among a variety of different products.
<p>
During out three terms in the JCP Executive Committee, we showed a good record of participation in the EC Meetings 
and reviewed the JSRs as part of the technology government service. Having a long tradition in the development of 
Java EE specifications, we managed to increase our participation in both Java SE and EE Expert Groups as well as 
Specification Leads.
<p>
We would like to continue our work on the following topics.<br>
Bring in our customer view and argue for strong, open and stable standards that can be implemented by any vendor 
or Open Source community for a competitive market, transparent license models, and easy JCP participation.<br>
Focus on technology governance and bring in our expertise in standardization and architecture governance. We 
complement this "process-oriented view" with our customer view and rather technical background and thus will 
continue to argue for a technical focus in the JCP EC.<br>
Continue our strong and active participation in Expert Groups and as Spec Leads, e.g., for the development, 
management, and operations of enterprise-scale applications in the cloud.

<p>
Fujitsu has a long history of implementing Java technologies, going back to 1996. Fujitsu has implemented Java 
across what is probably the broadest range of platforms in the industry --- from Main Frames Java to Java-Enabled 
Telephones. In Japan and around the world, Fujitsu is marketing its Java EE certified Interstage Application Server.
<p>

Fujitsu is a very active player in the Java community. Fujitsu has been a member of the JCP/Executive Committee since 
its inception. Throughout the years, Fujitsu has an outstanding record of JCP/EC meeting attendance and JSR balloting. 
At JavaOne in 2011, Mike DeNicola from Fujitsu was recognized as the "JCP Member of the Year".  Fujitsu has participated 
in most of the JCP/EC Press Events and JCP/EC Panels discussing the JCP and the role of the Executive Committee that have 
been held at JavaOne and in the US and Europe over the past several years.
<p>
Fujitsu has participated in and/or supported over fifty JSRs, including being Spec Lead and members of Expert Groups. 
Among these are revisions to the JCP Process (JCP 2.9, JCP 2.8, JCP 2.7, JCP 2.6, and JCP 2.5) and merger of the JCP Executive 
Committees (JSR355). Fujitsu was active in the Expert Groups creating and now updating JSPA 2, creating Java EE 7 and other key 
SE and EE umbrella JSRs. It has also participated in updating SIP Servlet Versions 1.1 and 2.0, plus various XML, Web Services, 
EJB, and JAIN JSRs.
<p>
Additionally, Fujitsu has strongly supported EJB application development and testing. It was a key member of DOPG 
(Distributed Object Promotion Group) in Japan which closed in 2011. Among other things, the group verified interoperability 
among member companies ORB products. It was the first group in the world to conduct EJB Interoperability Tests. Fujitsu is also 
a founding member of the Component Consortium for EJB and Fujitsu created a membership-based Component Center. Using the 
Fujitsu Interstage Application Server as the component runtime infrastructure, Fujitsu facilitates efficient application 
development by providing support services and assembling the newest set of EJB business components and standard EJB patterns. 
An application developer then adds Domain-specific and User-specific components.

<p>
SouJava (the "Java Users Society") is an established non-profit organization and Java User Group focused on strengthening 
the Brazilian Java developer community. Founded in 1998 and based in S&#227;o Paulo, SouJava congregates over 40 thousand 
members throughout the country. SouJava was the first JUG to join the JCP and has been active in the Process for 
almost a decade. During this time, the group had an important role on the open source of Java, to the point that 
Dr. Dobbs Magazine considered at the time Brazil as the reason for the release of OpenJDK. For the last two years, 
SouJava has used its role in the JCP EC to improve the participation of JUGs, individuals and small companies into 
shaping the future of Java by participating strongly on the Adopt-a-JSR program, with 80+ of the groups members involved 
in promoting and adopting JSRs and also leading the discussions that propose to increase membership and participation 
from individuals and non-profits into the JCP. 
<p>
SouJava considers the JCP a fundamental part of the Java ecosystem. The long-term success of Java depends on a process 
that encourages vendors, developers and users to contribute and innovate, and that gives everyone the necessary rights 
to implement the results. SouJava is committed to ensuring that the JCP is balanced and transparent, and that there 
is an equal standing among JCP members. As an active participant in open-source efforts, the group intends to help 
ensure that FOSS projects and implementations of Java standards are able to both bring contributions, and also to 
share process results. As a leading member of the worldwide Java Users Group Community, SouJava is committed to defend 
and promote JUG participation at the JCP.
<p>
For the last two years, as member of the JCP EC, SouJava has strived to bring its passion for community, JUGs, open source, standards, and Java to the JCP, and thus foster transparency and participation. After two years of strong involvement, we look forward to increase even more our relationship with the Java community, and we appreciate your support so we can continue to work towards a better JCP.

      <p>ABOUT THE JAVA COMMUNITY PROCESS (JCP) EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE</p>
      <p>After the Executive Committee (EC) Elections in 2012, the SE/EE and ME Executive Committees were merged into a single Executive Committee as defined by <a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.355.html">JSR 355</a> and the <a href="/en/procedures/jcp2_9">JCP 2.9 Process Document</a>.  In the merged Executive Committee, there are 16 Ratified Seats, 8 Elected Seats and the permanent seat held by Oracle America. Members serve 2-year terms that are staggered so that 12 of the 24 seats are normally up for ratification/election each year.</p>
      <p>The EC members guide the evolution of the Java technologies.
The EC
represents a cross-section of both major stakeholders and other members
of the Java Community. Duties are: select JSRs for development, approve
draft Specifications for Public Review, approve Final Specifications,
review TCK appeals, approve Maintenance revisions and possibly defer
some features to a new JSR, approve transfer of maintenance duties
between members and provide guidance to the Program Management Office
(PMO). For more information on the EC, see the Executive Committee Info
page <a href="/en/participation/committee">http://jcp.org/en/participation/committee</a>.
