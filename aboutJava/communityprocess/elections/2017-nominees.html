<p>
Credit Suisse is a global bank headquartered in Zurich, serving clients through three regionally focused divisions: 
Swiss Universal Bank, International Wealth Management and Asia Pacific. These regional businesses are supported by two other 
divisions specializing in investment banking capabilities: Global Markets and Investment Banking & Capital Markets. The bank 
has 530 offices and 22 booking centers located in over 50 countries. From the 46,000 employees, around 10,000 IT specialists 
work in application and infrastructure IT departments, in roles ranging from architecture, development, and operations. 
<p>
In 2010, Credit Suisse was elected in the JCP Executive Committee to be the first member to represent the customers of 
Java technology. Customers want strong and open standards to secure their investments and to choose among a variety of 
different products. 
<p>
During our four terms in the JCP Executive Committee, we have had a good record of participation in EC Meetings and reviewed 
JSRs as part of the technology government process. Having a long tradition in the development of Java EE specifications, we 
have managed to increase our participation in both Java SE and EE Expert Groups as well as Specification Leads. 
<p>
We would like to continue our work in the following areas:
<ul>
<li>Bring in our customer view and argue for strong, open and stable standards that can be implemented by any vendor or 
Open Source community for a competitive market, transparent license models, and easy JCP participation. 
<li>Focus on technology governance and bring in our expertise in standardization and architecture governance. We complement 
this "process-oriented view" with our customer view and rather technical background and thus will continue to argue for a 
technical focus in the JCP EC.
<li>Continue our strong and active participation in Expert Groups and as Spec Leads, e.g., for the development, management, 
and operations of enterprise-scale applications in the cloud.

<p>
Fujitsu has a long history of implementing Java technologies, going back to 1996. Fujitsu has implemented Java across what is probably the broadest range of platforms in the industry --- from Main Frames Java to Java-Enabled Telephones. In Japan and around the world, Fujitsu is marketing its Java EE certified Interstage Application Server. 
<p>
Fujitsu is a very active player in the Java community. Fujitsu has been a member of the JCP/Executive Committee since its inception. Throughout the years, Fujitsu has an outstanding record of JCP/EC meeting attendance and JSR balloting. At JavaOne in 2011, Mike DeNicola from Fujitsu was recognized as the "JCP Member of the Year". Fujitsu has participated in most of the JCP/EC Press Events and JCP/EC Panels discussing the JCP and the role of the Executive Committee that have been held at JavaOne and in the US and Europe over the past several years. 
<p>
Fujitsu has participated in and/or supported over fifty JSRs, including being Spec Lead and members of Expert Groups. Among these are revisions to the JCP Process (JCP 2.10, JCP2.9, JCP 2.8, JCP 2.7, JCP 2.6, and JCP 2.5) and merger of the JCP Executive Committees (JSR364). Fujitsu was active in the Expert Groups creating JSPA 2, Java EE 8, Java EE 7 and other key SE and EE umbrella JSRs. It has also participated in updating SIP Servlet Versions 1.1 and 2.0, plus various XML, Web Services, EJB, and JAIN JSRs.
<p>
Additionally, Fujitsu has strongly supported EJB application development and testing. It was a key member of DOPG (Distributed Object Promotion Group) in Japan which closed in 2011. Among other things, the group verified interoperability among member companies ORB products. It was the first group in the world to conduct EJB Interoperability Tests. Fujitsu is also a founding member of the Component Consortium for EJB and Fujitsu created a membership-based Component Center. Using the Fujitsu Interstage Application Server as the component runtime infrastructure, Fujitsu facilitates efficient application development by providing support services and assembling the newest set of EJB business components and standard EJB patterns. An application developer then adds Domain-specific and User-specific components.

<p>
Red Hat/JBoss have been involved with Java standardisation for a
decade, trying to represent the best values of open source
development, communities and innovation. We bring a wealth of
experience with growing vibrant open source communities and feeding
that into other standards efforts, such as OASIS and W3C and vice
versa. In recent years Red Hat has worked actively on JSR 348, 355 and
358 to improve and streamline the JCP processes, executive committees
and approach to openness.
<p>
Red Hat is actively involved in a large number of JSRs as well as
leading several, such as JSR 346, 303 and 347. We intend to continue
to be involved in JSRs for EE8, SE9, and beyond, as well as continuing
to contribute to OpenJDK. We believe that Java standardisation is
extremely important for the future of cloud, mobile, middleware and
much more.
<p>
Red Hat and JBoss fully support open source and open standards. We
believe that the JCP has an important role to play in both Java/JVM
open source and standards. Red Hat has worked closely with Sun, Oracle
and other members of the EC to push for a licensing model that creates
an open arena for everyone, including those not members of the JCP and
removes any ability for one individual or vendor to exert undue
control over a standard. We are an open source company and hence would
like to see such a licensing model for JCP contributions.
<p>
Red Hat has ensured that all of the JSRs that it leads are open and
fully inclusive. We have worked within other JSRs to encourage them to
likewise adopt an open policy because we believe strongly that this
benefits the industry and wider communities as a whole. Innovation and
standards are at their best when objective facts are used to drive
efforts and politics are left behind. The JCP EC has made some
significant improvements in these areas over the past few years but
Red Hat believes we still have a way to go and is committed to working
with others to see these improvements to completion.
<p>
In recent years Red Hat has been one of the leaders of Eclipse
MicroProfile, along with IBM, LJC TomiTribe and others, which has a
mission to advance enterprise Java at a more rapid pace, based upon
Java EE. Recently we have been working with Oracle and IBM to move
Java EE to the Eclipse Foundation under the EE4J project, where we
hope that the wider Java communities will be able to get more involved
than they have in the past. We remain committed to the advancement of
open source and enterprise Java wherever it resides.

SouJava (the "Java Users Society") is an established non-profit organization and Java User Group focused on strengthening the Brazilian Java developer community. Founded in 1998 and based in S&#227;o Paulo, SouJava congregates over 40 thousand members throughout the country. SouJava was the first JUG to join the JCP and has been active in the Process for almost a decade. During this time, the group had an important role on the open source of Java, to the point that Dr. Dobbs Magazine considered at the time Brazil as the reason for the release of OpenJDK. For the last two years, SouJava has used its role in the JCP EC to improve the participation of JUGs, individuals and small companies into shaping the future of Java by participating strongly on the Adopt-a-JSR program, with 80+ of the groups members involved in promoting and adopting JSRs and also leading the discussions that propose to increase membership and participation from individuals and non-profits into the JCP.
<p>
SouJava considers the JCP a fundamental part of the Java ecosystem. The long-term success of Java depends on a process that encourages vendors, developers and users to contribute and innovate, and that gives everyone the necessary rights to implement the results. SouJava is committed to ensuring that the JCP is balanced and transparent, and that there is an equal standing among JCP members. As an active participant in open-source efforts, the group intends to help ensure that FOSS projects and implementations of Java standards are able to both bring contributions, and also to share process results. As a leading member of the worldwide Java Users Group Community, SouJava is committed to defend and promote JUG participation at the JCP.
<p>
For the last two years, as member of the JCP EC, SouJava has strived to bring its passion for community, JUGs, open source, standards, and Java to the JCP, and thus foster transparency and participation. After two years of strong involvement, we look forward to increase even more our relationship with the Java community, and we appreciate your support so we can continue to work towards a better JCP.

Alibaba started engineering investments on OpenJDK early back to 2010.  Most of all the application in Alibaba are written in Java, with more than billion lines of Java code and more than 10,000 Java developers. We are in no doubt one of the largest installation base of Java in the world. We customize OpenJDK to meet the needs of rapidly growing business. Thousands of thousands of JVM instances are running Java every second, serving huge number of web requests and transacting Alibaba's full spectrum of services, including world's largest online ecommerce, financial and logistics marketplaces. Alibaba will continue to innovate Java infrastructure technology based on OpenJDK. We hope to bring our insights and experiences in using Java in super large scale datacenter to Java ecosystem by deeply involved in OpenJDK community.
<P>
Alibaba has a strong record of open source and community involvement. We custom-builds most of its software based on rich Java open-source ecosystem and we also contribute them back to community, including jStorm,  fastJSON etc. we have two OpenJDK committers, another one in expert group in JSR 353.
<p>
We believe Alibaba sitting on EC would be important to help to ensure Java community, both in terms of geography and technologies. 
Given Alibaba's leading role in China, indeed globally, Alibaba is willing to represent the voices of Java developer in EC 
discussion in broader way.  From technology perspective, as a member of JCP, Alibaba puts particular focus on ways to advance the role of 
Java in the web-scale area.  We try everything possible to enhance the Java technology to fulfill our requirements, from underlying JVM 
runtime, Java middleware, up to different aspects of JEE.
<p>
Alibaba already built and deployed customized OpenJDK with our specific changes. We optimize OpenJDK for online e-Commerce applications running on 100,000 servers. Many of these enhancements and improvements are generally applicable to most workloads, we are planning to cooperate with OpenJDK community and contribute back such changes. Specifically, we are planning to contribute Java warmup technology (similar to ZingTM ReadyNow ) which is already implemented in our customized OpenJDK version, widely used in Alibaba datacenter as JEP to OpenJDK, moreover, we commit to contribute to newly launched OpenJDK project loom, our customized OpenJDK version already implemented similar mechanism proposed by project loom. We believe our experiences on coroutine technology which is already widely deployed and used in Alibaba datacenter will definitely bring values to OpenJDK.

      <p>ABOUT THE JAVA COMMUNITY PROCESS (JCP) EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE</p>
      <p>After the Executive Committee (EC) Elections in 2012, the SE/EE and ME Executive Committees were merged into a single Executive Committee as defined by <a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.355.html">JSR 355</a> and the <a href="/en/procedures/jcp2_9">JCP 2.9 Process Document</a>.  In the merged Executive Committee, there are 16 Ratified Seats, 6 Elected Seats, 2 Associate Seats and the permanent seat held by Oracle America. Members serve 2-year terms that are staggered so that 12 of the 24 seats are normally up for ratification/election each year.</p>
      <p>The EC members guide the evolution of the Java technologies.
The EC
represents a cross-section of both major stakeholders and other members
of the Java Community. Duties are: select JSRs for development, approve
draft Specifications for Public Review, approve Final Specifications,
review TCK appeals, approve Maintenance revisions and possibly defer
some features to a new JSR, approve transfer of maintenance duties
between members and provide guidance to the Program Management Office
(PMO). For more information on the EC, see the Executive Committee Info
page <a href="http://jcp.org/en/participation/committee">http://jcp.org/en/participation/committee</a>.
