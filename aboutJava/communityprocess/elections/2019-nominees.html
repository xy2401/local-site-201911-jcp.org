<p>
SouJava (the "Java Users Society") is an established non-profit organization and Java User Group focused on strengthening 
the Brazilian Java developer community. Founded in 1998 and based in S&#227;o Paulo, SouJava congregates over 40 thousand 
members throughout the country. SouJava was the first JUG to join the JCP and has been active in the Process for almost 
a decade. During this time, the group had an important role on the open source of Java, to the point that Dr. Dobbs Magazine 
considered at the time Brazil as the reason for the release of OpenJDK. For the last two years, SouJava has used its role 
in the JCP EC to improve the participation of JUGs, individuals and small companies into shaping the future of Java by 
participating strongly on the Adopt-a-JSR program, with 80+ of the groups members involved in promoting and adopting JSRs 
and also leading the discussions that propose to increase membership and participation from individuals and non-profits 
into the JCP.
<p>
SouJava considers the JCP a fundamental part of the Java ecosystem. The long-term success of Java depends on a process 
that encourages vendors, developers and users to contribute and innovate, and that gives everyone the necessary rights 
to implement the results. SouJava is committed to ensuring that the JCP is balanced and transparent, and that there is 
an equal standing among JCP members. As an active participant in open-source efforts, the group intends to help ensure 
that FOSS projects and implementations of Java standards are able to both bring contributions, and also to share process 
results. As a leading member of the worldwide Java Users Group Community, SouJava is committed to defend and promote 
JUG participation at the JCP.
<p>
For the last two years, as member of the JCP EC, SouJava has strived to bring its passion for community, JUGs, open source, 
standards, and Java to the JCP, and thus foster transparency and participation. After two years of strong involvement, 
we look forward to increase even more our relationship with the Java community, and we appreciate your support so we can 
continue to work towards a better JCP.

Twitter relies on the JVM as the language runtime for its services. We are solving uniquely challenging problems when 
it comes to designing software at our scale and do so by heavily leveraging many open-source projects; some, like 
Finagle, we have created in-house and some, like OpenJDK, we have adopted, adapted, and actively contribute to. The main 
goal of our JCP EC membership is to ensure that OpenJDK remains a viable, high performance, and fully-featured open 
source platform.

<p>ABOUT THE JAVA COMMUNITY PROCESS (JCP) EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE</p>

<p>Under the JCP 2.11 rules, the EC will be resized.
<ul>
<li>For the 2019 annual elections, three Ratified and one Elected Seats will be eliminated, thereby reducing the EC to 21 members.</li>
<li>For the 2020 annual elections, two Ratified and one Elected Seats will be eliminated, thereby reducing the EC to 18 members.</li>
</ul>

After the 2020 annual elections, there will be 11 Ratified Seats, 4 Elected Seats, 2 Associate Seats and the permanent seat 
held by Oracle America. Members serve 2-year terms that are staggered so that 12 of the 24 seats are normally up for 
ratification/election each year. 

<p>The EC members guide the evolution of the Java technologies.  The EC
represents a cross-section of both major stakeholders and other members
of the Java Community. Duties are: select JSRs for development, approve
draft Specifications for Public Review, approve Final Specifications,
review TCK appeals, approve Maintenance revisions and possibly defer
some features to a new JSR, approve transfer of maintenance duties
between members and provide guidance to the Program Management Office
(PMO). For more information on the EC, see the Executive Committee Info
page <a href="http://jcp.org/en/participation/committee">http://jcp.org/en/participation/committee</a>.
