extensive multi-vendor relationships, give it deep experience with problems of interoperability and systems/software 
integration. As a major consumer of Java, Goldman Sachs is thus deeply invested in its future, and seeks to contribute to 
Java standards. The firm remains committed to the continued evolution of Java, both through the innovation of the broad 
Java community, and the ongoing process of standardization.
<P>
The firm participates on both individual and corporate levels in a broad range of industry forums and leadership groups, 
as well as technical conferences including: JavaOne, JavaDay Tokyo, EclipseCon North America & Europe, JVM Language Summit, 
QCon New York, QCon Beijing, NY Java SIG, Japan Java User Group CCC, London Java Community, Hong Kong Java User Group, GIDS; 
contributions to various open source projects, including OpenJDK, Zookeeper, Spark. Goldman Sachs is an active participant in 
the JCP EC and has participated in several JSR Expert Groups, as well as hosting Java User Group meet ups in London and New York. 
Goldman Sachs VP, Nikhil Nanivadekar was recently recognized by the Java community as a 2018 Java Champion. The firm has open 
sourced the Eclipse Collections library (formerly GS Collections) and several other Java frameworks.
<P>
As a member of the JCP Executive Committee, our representative, Jackie Haynes, would put particular focus on ways to advance 
the role of Java in the enterprise, and on continuing and furthering the ability for any vendor or open source community to 
participate in the development of Java through the JCP.

vendor and a significant java technology provider & consumer.
<P>
We have been on the JCP-EC for the past fnew years. The 
experience of the past two years has been very beneficial, though the 
process had been slow sometimes, as should be expected in a real 
standards body, especially when critical decisions are being made 
and significant changes are being legislated. 
<P>
Software AG is very much committed to keeping JCP open and 
equally accessible to individuals and enterprises of all sizes, with RF 
IP terms. We are delighted to find that the JCP next effort is in fact is 
getting close to bringing us close to that openness. We have the 
resources to support the activities of JCP and JCP EC. Thank you!

      <p>ABOUT THE JAVA COMMUNITY PROCESS (JCP) EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE</p>
      <p>After the Executive Committee (EC) Elections in 2012, the SE/EE and ME Executive Committees were merged into a single Executive Committee as defined by <a href="/en/jsr/detail.id=355">JSR 355</a> and the <a href="/en/procedures/jcp2_9">JCP 2.9 Process Document</a>.  In the merged Executive Committee, there are 16 Ratified Seats, 6 Elected Seats, 2 Associate Seats and the permanent seat held by Oracle America. Members serve 2-year terms that are staggered so that 12 of the 24 seats are normally up for ratification/election each year.</p>
      <p>The EC members guide the evolution of the Java technologies.
The EC
represents a cross-section of both major stakeholders and other members
of the Java Community. Duties are: select JSRs for development, approve
draft Specifications for Public Review, approve Final Specifications,
review TCK appeals, approve Maintenance revisions and possibly defer
some features to a new JSR, approve transfer of maintenance duties
between members and provide guidance to the Program Management Office
(PMO). For more information on the EC, see the Executive Committee Info
page <a href="http://jcp.org/en/participation/committee">http://jcp.org/en/participation/committee</a>.
