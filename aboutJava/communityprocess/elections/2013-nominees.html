Credit Suisse is a global bank headquartered in Zurich, serving clients in private banking, wealth management, and investment banking. The bank has 530 offices and 22 booking centers located in over 50 countries. From the 46000 employees, around 10000 IT specialists work in application and infrastructure IT departments, in roles ranging from architecture, development, and operations.<P>

In 2010, Credit Suisse was elected in the JCP SE/EE Executive Committee to be the first member to represent the customers of Java technology. Customers want strong and open standards to secure their investments and to choose among a variety of different products.<P>

During the first two terms in the JCP Executive Committee, we showed a good record of participation in the EC Meetings and reviewed the JSRs as part of the technology government service. Having a long tradition in the development of Java EE specifications, we managed to increase our participation in both Java SE and EE Expert Groups as well as Specification Leads.<P>

During our next term, we would like to work on the following topics.
<ul>
<li>Bring in our customer view and argue for strong, open and stable standards that can be implemented by any vendor or Open Source community for a competitive market, transparent license models, and easy JCP participation.
<li>Focus on technology governance and bring in our expertise in standardization and architecture governance. Continue to intensify content-wise JSR reviews within our internal Java community to reflect in the ballots the technical evolution of the Java platform.
<li>Continue our strong and active participation in Expert Groups and as Spec Leads, e.g., for the development, management, and operations of enterprise-scale applications in the cloud.

<p>
As a part of our joint development activities around "one box platform" supporting Oracle's secure service delivery platform based on Java, Freescale is also joining the Java Community Process (JCP) to work with Oracle and other JCP members on standard technical specifications for the Java platform. Our focus in the JCP will initially be on Java for resource-constrained processing platforms. We will also work with Oracle and other JCP members on new and enhanced Java APIs to improve the support for IoT protocols, and features available on MCUs and  edge/ sensing nodes. Furthermore, we are working directly with Oracle on optimizing the MQX<sup>TM</sup> RTOS to work as a native hardware abstraction layer (HAL) to work optimally with Oracle Java ME Embedded.<P>

This is the new horizon for Java developers and we would like to enable the Java community to use Java ME on MCUs and other resource constrained devices. The work that we already have done with Java ME as a part of the new Freescale+Oracle IoT platform, can be a guiding light to the rest of the community, for what needs to be done.

<p>
Fujitsu has a long history of implementing Java technologies, going back to 1996. Fujitsu has implemented Java across what is probably the broadest range of platforms in the industry --- from Main Frames Java to Java-Enabled Telephones. In Japan and around the world, Fujitsu is marketing its J2EE certified Interstage Application Server.<P>

Fujitsu is a very active player in the Java community. Fujitsu has been a member of the JCP/Executive Committee since its inception. Throughout the years, Fujitsu has an outstanding record of JCP/EC meeting attendance and JSR balloting. At JavaOne in 2011, Mike DeNicola from Fujitsu was recognized as the "JCP Member of the Year." Fujitsu has participated in most of the JCP/EC Press Events and JCP/EC Panels discussing the JCP and the role of the Executive Committee that have been held at JavaOne and in the US and Europe over the past several years.<P>

Fujitsu has participated in and/or supported over fifty JSRs, including being Spec Lead and members of Expert Groups. Among these are revisions to the JCP Process (JCP 2.9, JCP 2.8, JCP 2.7, JCP 2.6, and JCP 2.5) and merger of the JCP Executive Committees (JSR355). Fujitsu was active in the Expert Groups creating and now updating JSPA 2, creating Java EE 7 and other key SE and EE umbrella JSRs. It has also participated in updating SIP Servlet Versions 1.1 and 2.0, plus various XML, Web Services, EJB, and JAIN JSRs.<P>

Additionally, Fujitsu has strongly supported EJB application development and testing. It was a key member of DOPG (Distributed Object Promotion Group) in Japan which closed in 2011. Among other things, the group verified interoperability among member companies ORB products. It was the first group in the world to conduct EJB Interoperability Tests. Fujitsu is also a founding member of the Component Consortium for EJB and Fujitsu created a membership-based Component Center. Using the Fujitsu Interstage Application Server as the component runtime infrastructure, Fujitsu facilitates efficient application development by providing support services and assembling the newest set of EJB business components and standard EJB patterns. An application developer then adds Domain-specific and User-specific components.<P>

Gemalto M2M GmbH, formerly Cinterion Wireless Modules GmbH started as a spin-off from Siemens Mobile Phones, pioneering cellular connectivity for machine to machine (M2M) communication. Gemalto M2M offers a broad range of cellular M2M modules spanning from 2G to 4G, a variety of SIM and MIM running JavaCard as well as service enablement platforms. Gemalto M2M has been engaged for more than 10 years in Java for M2M. The JSR195 (IMP) introduced 2003 together with Nokia was the first Java ME profile for headless devices, followed by the JSR228 (IMP-NG) which was created in 2005. Today Gemalto M2M offers a broad portfolio of Java modules based on the latest Java ME releases. In addition, ready to use development environments such as the "Concept Board" and gateway boxes enable a fast start into Java for M2M.<P>

We in Gemalto M2M strongly believe in Java as the ideal programming platform and language for M2M and the Internet of things, today and in the future. Therefore for the next term we would like to further push Java into the M2M space and to the embedded developer community and also support the convergence process of Java ME and Java SE.

Goldman Sachs is a financial services firm built on its global technology enterprise. Development at the firm is overwhelmingly Java-based, with more than 130 million lines of Java code under management, and more than 3,000 developers in its Java user group implementing systems which are then leveraged by over 10,000 end-users.<P>

Goldman Sachs custom-builds most of its software, and its historical reliance on open source components, as well as its extensive multi-vendor relationships, give it deep experience with problems of interoperability and systems/software integration. As a major consumer of Java, Goldman Sachs is thus deeply invested in its future, and seeks to contribute to Java standards. We remain committed to the continued evolution of Java, both through the innovation of the broad Java community, and the ongoing process of standardization.<P>

The firm participates on both individual and corporate levels in a broad range of industry forums and leadership groups, including: Java One (presenting "Java on 40,000 desktops"); The Hong Kong Java User Group (which is run by a member of the firm); contributions to the Fitnesse acceptance testing framework; and various open source projects, including Zookeeper, the Trove Collections framework and OpenJDK. Goldman Sachs is an active participant in the JCP EC and several JSR Expert Groups, We have hosted Java User Group meet ups in London and New York. We have open sourced GS Collections, a Lambda-Ready Java Collections Framework.<P>

As a member of the JCP Executive Committee, our representative, John Weir, would put particular focus on ways to advance the role of Java in the enterprise, and on furthering cross-vendor integration. Areas of specific interest include management features, parallel processing, serialization, cloud / dynamic computing and security.<P>

Twitter relies on the JVM as the base runtime for its service, with almost all of our new software being written in Java or Scala. We are solving some uniquely challenging problems when it comes to designing software at our scale and are developing libraries for scalable IO, distributed scatter-gather, and system monitoring and management. We hope to bring our insight in high-traffic, low latency large-deployment, multi-language systems to forming the aspects and details of the relevant JSRs to further the platform. We need to ensure that our systems can cope with the traffic increases that today bring us in the domain of 500 million tweets per day. Internal metrics system via Zipkin that does 170 million individual metrics (time-series) every minute and serves up 200 million queries per day.<P>

Furthermore, we are beginning to diversify our usage of programming languages available on the JVM; in addition to already widespread usage of Java and Scala, we are beginning to write systems that use Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and Clojure runtimes on JVM. We hope to bring our insight in high-traffic, low latency large-deployment, multi-language systems to forming the aspects and details of the relevant JSRs to further the platform. Twitter has a strong record of community involvement since its inception, with most of our internally developed software that is deemed useful to public in general being open sourced.

The EC
represents a cross-section of both major stakeholders and other members
of the Java Community. Duties are: select JSRs for development, approve
draft Specifications for Public Review, approve Final Specifications,
review TCK appeals, approve Maintenance revisions and possibly defer
some features to a new JSR, approve transfer of maintenance duties
between members and provide guidance to the Program Management Office
(PMO). For more information on the EC, see the Executive Committee Info
