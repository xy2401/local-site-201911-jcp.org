<p>
Gemalto M2M GmbH, formerly Cinterion Wireless Modules GmbH started as a spin-off from Siemens Mobile Phones, 
pioneering cellular connectivity for machine to machine (M2M) communication. Gemalto offers a broad range of 
IoT connectivity solutions spanning from 2G to 4G, a variety of industrial grade SIMs (MIM) running JavaCard 
as well as several cloud-based platforms. Gemalto has been engaged for more than 10 years in Java for Industrial IoT. 
The JSR 195 (IMP) introduced together with Nokia in 2003 was the first Java ME profile for headless devices, 
followed by the JSR 228 (IMP-NG) which was created in 2005. Today Gemalto offers a broad portfolio of Java enabled 
Cinterion cellular modules and terminals. In addition, development kits such as the Cinterion Concept Board and 
gateways enable a fast start into embedded Java for the IoT. 
<P>
At Gemalto, we strongly believe in the power of Java as the ideal platform for M2M and the Internet of things, 
today and in the future. Therefore, for the next JCP term we are committed to further promote Java in the Industrial 
IoT space, serve and support the embedded developer community and also drive the convergence process of Java ME 
and Java SE.

Goldman Sachs is a financial services firm built on its global technology enterprise. Development at the 
firm is overwhelmingly Java-based, with more than 130 million lines of Java code under management, and more 
than 3,000 developers in its Java user group implementing systems which are then leveraged by the majority 
of the firm's end-users.
<P>
The firm custom-builds most of its software, and its historical reliance on open source components, as well 
as its extensive multi-vendor relationships, give it deep experience with problems of interoperability and 
systems/software integration. As a major consumer of Java, Goldman Sachs is thus deeply invested in its future, 
and seeks to contribute to Java standards. The firm remains committed to the continued evolution of Java, both 
through the innovation of the broad Java community, and the ongoing process of standardization.
<P>
The firm participates on both individual and corporate levels in a broad range of industry forums and leadership 
groups, as well as technical conferences including: JavaOne, JavaDay Tokyo, EclipseCon North America & Europe, 
JVM Language Summit, QCon New York, QCon Beijing, NY Java SIG, Japan Java User Group CCC, London Java Community, 
Hong Kong Java User Group; contributions to various open source projects, including OpenJDK, Zookeeper, Fitnesse 
acceptance testing framework. Goldman Sachs is an active participant in the JCP EC and several JSR Expert Groups, 
and has hosted Java User Group meet ups in London and New York. The firm has open sourced the Eclipse Collections 
library (formerly GS Collections), Xsd2Bean (XML to Object Mapper), and Reladomo, an enterprise-ready ORM Framework.
<P>
As a member of the JCP Executive Committee, our representative, Donald Raab, would put particular focus on ways to 
advance the role of Java in the enterprise, and on furthering cross-vendor integration. Areas of specific interest 
include management features, parallel processing, serialization, cloud / dynamic computing and security.

Although we are very new to the JCP program with little or no experiences with its activities and

committee by submitting this application.
<P>
Alibaba is in no doubt one of the largest installation base of Java in the world. Tens of thousands of 
machines are running Javas every second, serving insurmountable number of web requests and transacting 
Alibaba's full spectrum of services, including world's largest online ecommerce marketplaces. We not only 
beat anybody in the world in the above numbers, but also single-day transaction volumes on November 11th of 
the past 6 or 7 years. Therefore, we, the JVM group in Alibaba, care the most about its performance, usability 
and everything. We thrived to try everything possible to enhance different aspects of the Java to fulfill 
our requirements. Being in the committee will help the community to understand all different kinds of problems 
and challenges we face everyday here in Alibaba, and we firmly believe this.
<P>
Along with all the work we have done in recent years, we did identify areas that could have been emphasized 
more or even re-designed to better serve us. This includes garbage collection, deployment, just-in-time compilation 
and serveral other components. What is more important is that the environment we are facing is mostly a web server 
one, where short sessions come and go very quickly. We once again firmly believe that JVM/JDK/middleware may 
accommandate better by assuming certain behavior and workload with web server characteristics. We therefore think 
joining the committee will help us express that. We would like to influence.
<P>
By helping the community as much as we can, by contributing our thoughts and ideas, by sharing our experiences, 
and by influencing direction of Java, we find the best place with EC of JCP for doing all these.
<P>
Thank you for your kindly consideration.

I have been a professional software developer since age of 15, and have used Java in a range of industries 
from e-commerce, media delivery, mobile, and adtech. I've used Java in anger since 1998 (and Java made me 
angry back then) and was a member of the JCP EC for 7 years representing the Apache Software foundation until 2010. 
During my tenure as EC rep, the ASF won EC Member of the Year three times. I have been heavily involved in open source 
over the years, having served several times as a Director of the ASF, and helped co-found and lead several Apache 
projects, including Apache Geronimo (Java EE), Apache Harmony (Java SE) and other projects. In 2010, I retired 
from JCP activities at the conclusion of the Apache-Sun/Oracle dispute over open and fair access to TCK licenses.  
In 2015, I felt it was time to re-engage, and have served the last two years as an independent. While I remain a 
Member of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), I again am running as an independent individual, and do not and 
will not speak for the Apache Software Foundation.

I'm running again because of my interest in the JCP and the governance of the Java ecosystem. I continue to

and I believe that with continued good governance, will remain the best general purpose development platform for 
the foreseeable future. I am an active developer - I write and deploy code to production multiple times per 
week. I think that I bring a valuable perspective to the JCP, one that spans commercial enterprise development, 
commercial individual/consultant development and community-oriented open source development, and this perspective 
incorporates an understanding of the balance between the needs of commercial development and the value of open 
source and free software. Finally I believe that my years of experience representing the ASF on the EC gives 
me a solid understanding of the general dynamics at play in the ecosystem, and am able to leverage that 
experience as a representative of the individual practitioner.

example, hundreds of millions of tweets sent per day) and able to scale to higher traffic levels in the future. 
We also want to ensure that our services run efficiently at data-center scale, maintaining high quality of 
service while minimizing data-center footprint. We hope to bring our insight in high traffic, low latency, 
large deployment, multi-language systems when evaluating and giving feedback on new JSRs in order to expand 
and enhance the Java platform in the most constructive and useful way.

Twitter has a very strong record of community involvement since its inception, with most of our internally

We get enormous value from OpenJDK being an open-source platform. We are able to build and deploy OpenJDK with 
Twitter-specific changes to optimize it for our workloads and use cases. Many of these enhancements and

      <p>ABOUT THE JAVA COMMUNITY PROCESS (JCP) EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE</p>
      <p>After the Executive Committee (EC) Elections in 2012, the SE/EE and ME Executive Committees were merged into a single Executive Committee as defined by <a href="/en/jsr/detail.id=355">JSR 355</a> and the <a href="/en/procedures/jcp2_9">JCP 2.9 Process Document</a>.  In the merged Executive Committee, there are 16 Ratified Seats, 8 Elected Seats and the permanent seat held by Oracle America. Members serve 2-year terms that are staggered so that 12 of the 24 seats are normally up for ratification/election each year.</p>
      <p>The EC members guide the evolution of the Java technologies.
The EC
represents a cross-section of both major stakeholders and other members
of the Java Community. Duties are: select JSRs for development, approve
draft Specifications for Public Review, approve Final Specifications,
review TCK appeals, approve Maintenance revisions and possibly defer
some features to a new JSR, approve transfer of maintenance duties
between members and provide guidance to the Program Management Office
(PMO). For more information on the EC, see the Executive Committee Info
page <a href="http://jcp.org/en/participation/committee">http://jcp.org/en/participation/committee</a>.
