<p>
As a part of our joint development activities around "one box platform" supporting Oracle's 
secure service delivery platform based on Java, Freescale is also joining the Java 
Community Process (JCP) to work with Oracle and other JCP members on standard technical 
specifications for the Java platform. Our focus in the JCP will initially be on Java for 
resource-constrained processing platforms. We will also work with Oracle and other JCP members 
on new and enhanced Java APIs to improve the support for IoT protocols, and features available 
on MCUs and edge/ sensing nodes. Furthermore, we are working directly with Oracle on optimizing 
the MQX<sup>TM</sup> RTOS to work as a native hardware abstraction layer (HAL) to work 
optimally with Oracle Java ME Embedded.
<p>
This is the new horizon for Java developers and we would like to enable the Java community 
to use Java ME on MCUs and other resource constrained devices. The work that we already have 
done with Java ME as a part of the new Freescale+Oracle IoT platform, can be a guiding light 
to the rest of the community, for what needs to be done.

Gemalto M2M GmbH, formerly Cinterion Wireless Modules GmbH started as a spin-off from 
Siemens Mobile Phones, pioneering cellular connectivity for machine to machine (M2M) 
communication. Gemalto M2M offers a broad range of cellular M2M connectivity solutions 
spanning from 2G to 4G, a variety of SIM and MIM running JavaCard as well as M2M cloud 
platform. Gemalto M2M has been engaged for more than 10 years in Java for M2M. 
The JSR195 (IMP) introduced 2003 together with Nokia was the first Java ME profile for 
headless devices, followed by the JSR228 (IMP-NG) which was created in 2005. Today Gemalto 
M2M offers a broad portfolio of Java enabled cellular modules. In addition, ready to use 
development environments such as the "Concept Board" and gateway boxes enable a fast start 
into Java for M2M.
<p>
We in Gemalto M2M strongly believe in Java as the ideal platform for M2M and the Internet of 
things, today and in the future. Therefore for the next term we would like to further promote 
Java in the M2M space and the embedded developer community and also support the convergence 
process of Java ME and Java SE.

<p>
Goldman Sachs is a financial services firm built on its global technology enterprise. 
Development at the firm is overwhelmingly Java-based, with more than 130 million lines 
of Java code under management, and more than 3,000 developers in its Java user group 
implementing systems which are then leveraged by over 10,000 end-users.
<p>
Goldman Sachs custom-builds most of its software, and its historical reliance on open source 
components, as well as its extensive multi-vendor relationships, give it deep experience with 
problems of interoperability and systems/software integration. As a major consumer of Java, 
Goldman Sachs is thus deeply invested in its future, and seeks to contribute to Java standards. 
We remain committed to the continued evolution of Java, both through the innovation of the broad 
Java community, and the ongoing process of standardization.
<p>
The firm participates on both individual and corporate levels in a broad range of industry forums 
and leadership groups, including: Java One (presenting "Java on 40,000 desktops"); The Hong Kong 
Java User Group (which is run by a member of the firm); contributions to the Fitnesse acceptance 
testing framework; and various open source projects, including Zookeeper, the Trove Collections 
framework and OpenJDK. Goldman Sachs is an active participant in the JCP EC and several JSR Expert 
Groups, We have hosted Java User Group meet ups in London and New York. We have open sourced 
GS Collections, a Lambda-Ready Java Collections Framework.
<p>
As a member of the JCP Executive Committee, our representative, John Weir, would put particular 
focus on ways to advance the role of Java in the enterprise, and on furthering cross-vendor 
integration. Areas of specific interest include management features, parallel processing, 
serialization, cloud / dynamic computing and security.

I have been a professional software developer since age of 15, and have used Java in a range 
of industries from e-commerce, media delivery, mobile, and adtech.  I've used Java in anger 
since 1998 (and Java made me angry back then) and was a member of the JCP EC for 7 years 
representing the Apache Software foundation until 2010.  During my tenure as EC rep, the 
ASF won EC Member of the Year three times.  I have been heavily involved in open source 
over the years, having served several times as a Director of the ASF, and helped co-found and 
lead several Apache projects, including Apache Geronimo (Java EE), Apache Harmony (Java SE) 
and other projects.  In 2010, I retired from JCP activities at the conclusion of the 
Apache-Sun/Oracle dispute over open and fair access to TCK licenses.  While I remain a 
Member of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), I am running as an independent individual, 
and do not and will not speak for the Apache Software Foundation.
<p>
I'm running because I have never lost my interest in the JCP and the governance of the 
Java ecosystem - I just needed a break.  I continue to believe that the Java ecosystem is 
by far the best general purpose development platform we have available today, and I believe 
that with continued good governance, will be the best general purposed development platform for 
the foreseeable future.  I am an active developer - I write and deploy code to production multiple 
times per week.  I think that I can bring a valuable perspective to the JCP, one that spans 
commercial enterprise development, commercial individual/consultant development and community-oriented 
open source development, and this perspective incorporates an understanding of the balance between 
the needs of commercial development and the value of open source and free software.  Finally I 
believe that my years of experience representing the ASF on the EC gives me a solid understanding of 
the general dynamics at play in the ecosystem, and will be able to leverage that experience as a 
representative of the individual practitioner.

develop using Java and ultimately all of us as these technologies touch every 
aspect of our daily lives.

      <p>ABOUT THE JAVA COMMUNITY PROCESS (JCP) EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE</p>
      <p>After the Executive Committee (EC) Elections in 2012, the SE/EE and ME Executive Committees were merged into a single Executive Committee as defined by <a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.355.html">JSR 355</a> and the <a href="/en/procedures/jcp2_9">JCP 2.9 Process Document</a>.  In the merged Executive Committee, there are 16 Ratified Seats, 8 Elected Seats and the permanent seat held by Oracle America. Members serve 2-year terms that are staggered so that 12 of the 24 seats are normally up for ratification/election each year.</p>
      <p>The EC members guide the evolution of the Java technologies.
The EC
represents a cross-section of both major stakeholders and other members
of the Java Community. Duties are: select JSRs for development, approve
draft Specifications for Public Review, approve Final Specifications,
review TCK appeals, approve Maintenance revisions and possibly defer
some features to a new JSR, approve transfer of maintenance duties
between members and provide guidance to the Program Management Office
(PMO). For more information on the EC, see the Executive Committee Info
page <a href="http://jcp.org/en/participation/committee">http://jcp.org/en/participation/committee</a>.
