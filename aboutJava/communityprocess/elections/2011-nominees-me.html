<p>SK Telecom has launched the SKVM that is runtime Java environment for embedded systems for mobile devices. In the market we released more than 5000 handsets since first commercialization in 2001. The SKVM Java platform makes various kinds of applications and contents run on mobile handsets. Under its environment, services and applications such as Games, Instant Messenger, Real time car navigation, Data streaming, Real-time graphic based commerce, Entertainment, Information can run on mobile handsets, which makes mobile life more fun and richer. 
<p>As part of the JCP, SK Telecom has actively participated and  been a Spec lead of JSRs. The JSR-298, Telematics API for Java ME, is the first attempt in standardizing JSR specifically designed to provide Telematics services and is based on widely used Java ME platform technology.  Telematics services can be provided through implementing JSR298 on many common portable devices such as mobile handsets and PDAs. This will result in increasing the presence of various Java technologies and broadening their impact in the market through JSR298 and development of Telematics services. The JSR-327 Dynamic Contents Delivery Service API is to use the push mechanism to send all the required data content of the applications or services that have been subscribed by the users. It also provide standard way for application to interact with content delivery mechanism�OMA DCD based or proprietary DCD mechanisms. 

<p>With the experience in JSR development as well as our service platform commercialization, SK Telecom will provide opportunities for various existing Java technologies to naturally expand to new fields such as automotive industry and other organizations.

<p>I worked with Java since the first JDK. Having created solutions in paradigms of what we know as Portals, Social Networks,... today. I joined the JCP EC 3 years ago at a critical and difficult phase and helped many JSRs including EE6 or the first part of JCP.next. Having worked in Mobile/Teleco for most of those 3 years as well to support merging the ECs via the upcoming JCP.next steps, I decided to run for what is still ME EC until that work is done and the JCP as well as Java itself unified.

<! -- Qualifications -->
<p>As noted in my biography, I have had broad exposure in the academic, 
entrepreneurial and �big company� executive sandboxes. I will briefly 
describe my qualifications for the Java ME EC.

<p>First, I have been a member of the ME EC for the past 6 months, filling 
in for a seat that was vacated. During that 6 months, I have had the 
opportunity to get my hands dirty and dive into some of the issues that 
we face going forward. I took part in the JSR 348, Java.next process.

<p>Before joining the EC, I was a developer of several projects that use 
Java. As I mentioned in my biography, I used Java ME on feature phones 
to deliver behavior modification programs. This work was funded by the 
National Institutes of Health. The Java ME phones would communicate for 
Java EE software as well as C programs running on embedded devices. At 
the time I was unaware that Java could run on such small devices. Had I 
known, I would have saved myself several hundreds of hours. I have spent 
the last six months investigating Java on embedded devices. The 
community at large is not aware of this fact. Indeed, Java ME is very 
powerful but that is not widely known. Regardless, I have a deep 
understanding of embedded devices and applications. I believe I can help 
evangelize Java on embedded.

<p>I have also worked extensively with the Java Media APIs and, with 
co�authors, wrote a book about Java 3D, Java Advanced Imaging and the 
Java Media Framework. A lot of the VR research I conducted at the NIH 
used Java3D to control the presentation of 3D and VR stimuli. I used 
Java3D environments in a functional MRI scanner. I also used all of the 
really cool head tracking and stereoscopic presentation capabilities 
that Java3D had.

<p>Overall, I have a lot of interest in Kinect, JavaFX, Java TV, Java ME on 
mobile phones and embedded systems. I believe I can make a strong 
contribution to �Moving Java Forward�.

<p>My career has been focused on technology development based on brain 
science (e.g., computer vision, neural networks, and information 
theory). Although, I am running for an individual seat on the Java ME 
EC, my current title is Vice President of Innovation at the Nielsen 
Company. I have had this new position for less than one month. I am 
charged with bringing additional entrepreneurial vigor to the research 
and development efforts at Nielsen.

<p>From 2003� - 2011 I was President and Chief Scientist of MediaBalance, 
Inc., a company I began in my garage. During that time, I won $1.5 
million in federal funding from the Small Business Innovation Research 
(SBIR) programs of the National Institutes of Health, National Science 
Foundation, and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Those 
projects were focused on mobile and embedded platforms for modifying 
behavior. My interest in JavaME stems from that work.

<p>Prior to starting my own company, I had an academic career as a PhD 
student in Cognition and Neural Systems and, later, as a Professor. 
Because I have been an executive, entrepreneur, and academic, I believe 
I can bring a broad perspective to the Java ME EC because I understand 
the needs at multiple levels. I believe I can provide a unique 
perspective to the Java community.

      <p>ABOUT THE JAVA COMMUNITY PROCESS (JCP) EXECUTIVE COMMITTEES </p>
      <p>The JCP has two Executive Committees (EC) -
Standard/Enterprise &amp; Micro
Edition, each targets different markets for the Java Platform. Voting
Members on each EC serve 3-year terms; there are 10 Ratified Seats, 5
Elected Seats, and the permanent seat held by Sun Microsystems, Inc.
The
3-year terms are staggered so that 5 of the 15 seats are normally up
for
ratification/election each year. </p>
      <p>The EC members guide the evolution of the Java technologies.
The EC
represents a cross-section of both major stakeholders and other members
of the Java Community. Duties are: select JSRs for development, approve
draft Specifications for Public Review, approve Final Specifications,
review TCK appeals, approve Maintenance revisions and possibly defer
some features to a new JSR, approve transfer of maintenance duties
between members and provide guidance to the Program Management Office
(PMO). For more information on the EC, see the Executive Committee Info
page <a href="/en/participation/committee">http://jcp.org/en/participation/committee</a>.
