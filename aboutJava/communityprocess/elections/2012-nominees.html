<p>
Cinterion Wireless Modules GmbH started as a spin-off of Siemens Mobile Phones focusing in M2M GSM modules. Today Cinterion is a part of Gemalto N.V., the world leader in digital security. For the first M2M Java module in 2003 Cinterion leaded together with Nokia JSR195 (IMP) a JavaME profile suitable for headless devices. For the next generation of Java modules JSR228 (IMP-NG) was created in 2005. Since then Cinterion developed a broad portfolio of Java modules for M2M and Automotive.<p> 

We in Cinterion strongly believe in Java as the M2M programming platform and language, today and in the future. It is our desire to help shaping this future.

<p>
In 2009, Credit Suisse was elected in the JCP SE/EE Executive Committee to be the first member to represent the customers of Java technology. Customers want strong and open standards to secure their investments and to choose among a variety of different products.<P>

During the first term in the JCP Executive Committee, we showed a good record of participation in the EC Meetings and reviewed the JSRs as part of the technology government service. Having a long tradition in the development of Java EE specifications, we managed to increase our participation in both Java SE and EE Expert Groups as well as Specification Leads. We are very proud that Victor Grazi, one of our core Java architects, has won the JCP Outstanding Spec Lead Award 2012!<P>

During our next term, we would like to work on the following topics.

<ul>
<li>Bring in our customer view and argue for strong, open and stable standards that can be implemented by any vendor or Open Source community for a competitive market, transparent license models, and easy JCP participation.
<li>Focus on technology governance and bring in our expertise in standardization and architecture governance. Intensify content-wise JSR reviews within our internal Java community. Continue our strong and active participation in Expert Groups and as Spec Leads.
<li>Aid in increasing university participation as Spec Leads and Expert Group Members, on both faculty (e.g., contribute to high-quality specifications) and student level (e.g., as part of the Adopt-a-JSR initiative of the Java User Groups).

<! -- Qualifications -->

<p>Fujitsu has a long history of implementing Java technologies, going back to 1996. Fujitsu has implemented Java across what is probably the broadest range of platforms in the industry --- from Main Frames Java to Java-Enabled Telephones. In Japan and around the world, Fujitsu is marketing its J2EE certified Interstage Application Server.
<p>
Fujitsu is a very active player in the Java community. Fujitsu has been a member of the JCP/Executive Committee since its inception. Throughout the years, Fujitsu has an outstanding record of JCP/EC meeting attendance and JSR balloting. At JavaOne in 2011, Mike DeNicola from Fujitsu was awarded &#34;JCP Member of the Year&#34;. Fujitsu has participated in most of the JCP/EC Press Events and JCP/EC Panels discussing the JCP and the role of the Executive Committee that have been held in the US and Europe over the past several years.
<p>
Fujitsu has participated in and/or supported over fifty JSRs, including being Spec Lead and members of Expert Groups. Among these are revisions to the JCP Process (JCP 2.8, 2.7, JCP 2.6, and JCP 2.5) and merger of the JCP Executive Committees. Fujitsu was active in creating and now updating JSPA 2, creating Java EE 7 and other key SE/EE umbrella JSRs, updating SIP Servlet Versions 1.1 and 2.0, plus various XML, Web Services, EJB, and JAIN JSRs.
<p>
Additionally, Fujitsu has strongly supported EJB application development and testing. It was a key member of DOPG (Distributed Object Promotion Group) in Japan which closed in 2011. Among other things, the group verified interoperability among member companies ORB products. It was the first group in the world to conduct EJB Interoperability Tests. Fujitsu is also a founding member of the Component Consortium for EJB and Fujitsu created a membership-based Component Center. Using the Fujitsu Interstage Application Server as the component runtime infrastructure, Fujitsu facilitates efficient application development by providing support services and assembling the newest set of EJB business components and standard EJB patterns. An application developer then adds Domain-specific and User-specific components.<p>

<p>Hewlett-Packard is proud to be nominated for a Ratified Seat on the JCP Executive Committee for another term.<P>

HP is committed to Java and the JCP.  HP supplies Java technology across virtually all of our computing product lines, ranging from our high-end <i>Integrity</i> servers to our PC product families.  We have been active on the EC since its inception in 2000.  During that time, our emphasis in the EC has been on improving the openness and inclusiveness of the JCP, and ensuring the EC fulfills its role as an effective governance body for the development of Java technologies.  We remain committed to continuing to evolve the JCP into a more open and fair process that maintains Java as a leading technology in the marketplace.<P>

As we enter this election period, we are beginning the evolution of JCP governance with the merging of the 2 Executive Committees.  Work has begun on revising the membership documents underpinning the JCP and we look forward to continuing our efforts in this important area.  Throughout the next year, HP will continue to adhere to the principles of openness, transparency and a level playing field for all to guide our actions in the JCP EC.<P>

We&#39;re excited about collaborating with our fellow EC members to ensure Java and the JCP continue to prosper.  HP looks forward to working with the Java community as an EC member for the next year and we appreciate your support in this election.

Eighteen months ago, the London Java Community pledged to improve the openness and transparency of the Java Community Process if elected to the JCP Executive Committee. We also promised to help bridge the gap between the decision makers and on-the-ground developers.<p>

Our voting record and active participation in the JCP show that we have made real progress towards these goals. In addition, we achieved more than even we imagined by launching and championing Adopt-a-JSR, a global program that has both improved feedback to expert groups from developers, and increased involvement from the people who use Java everyday in their professional capacities.<p>

If re-elected, we will continue actively improving the openness and transparency of the JCP, and expand our successful programs to voice the needs of developers and communities worldwide. See our position paper for in-depth detail on what we've achieved and where we want to go.

The JUG is very active in the Adopt-a-JSR programe and is also one of the three JUGs that volunteered to work in the AdoptOpenJDK bugathon instructors training pilot initiative.<P>

The Morocco JUG want to join the JCP Executive Committee to act as a voice for the Java community in general, but especially the African and Arabic Java Community in order to improve their picture and prove that those communities are also contributing to the Java ecosystem and not only consuming the Java technology.

The EC
represents a cross-section of both major stakeholders and other members
of the Java Community. Duties are: select JSRs for development, approve
draft Specifications for Public Review, approve Final Specifications,
review TCK appeals, approve Maintenance revisions and possibly defer
some features to a new JSR, approve transfer of maintenance duties
between members and provide guidance to the Program Management Office
