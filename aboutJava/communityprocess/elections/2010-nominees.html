<B>Red Hat Middleware LLC</b>
</td>
<td>
Red Hat has been active in standards for over many years, working in the OMG, OASIS, W3C as well as the JCP, where they have been on the EC since 2006. Red Hat participates in several JSRs and leads standardization efforts across organizations. Red Hat has also been active in implementing a range of these standards, as well as those from the Java Community Process, so has an important perspective of practical applicability of standards to real world problems. As far as the JCP and EC are concerns, Red Hat views them as critical to the future of Java as a set of technologies as well as communities. Open source is extremely important in the software world today and the JCP has already made efforts to embrace it over the past few years. However, there are still areas where open source approaches to development and communication, as well as open source approaches to "open standards" can offer improvements to the JCP effort as well as the EC, and Red Hat will be active with other members to continue to evolve the JCP and EC to ensure continued relevancy as well as vibrancy.</td>

      <p>ABOUT THE JAVA COMMUNITY PROCESS (JCP) EXECUTIVE COMMITTEES </p>
      <p>The JCP has two Executive Committees (EC) -
Standard/Enterprise &amp; Micro
Edition, each targets different markets for the Java Platform. Voting
Members on each EC serve 3-year terms; there are 10 Ratified Seats, 5
Elected Seats, and the permanent seat held by Sun Microsystems, Inc.
The
3-year terms are staggered so that 5 of the 15 seats are normally up
for
ratification/election each year. </p>
      <p>The EC members guide the evolution of the Java technologies.
The EC
represents a cross-section of both major stakeholders and other members
of the Java Community. Duties are: select JSRs for development, approve
draft Specifications for Public Review, approve Final Specifications,
review TCK appeals, approve Maintenance revisions and possibly defer
some features to a new JSR, approve transfer of maintenance duties
between members and provide guidance to the Program Management Office
(PMO). For more information on the EC, see the Executive Committee Info
