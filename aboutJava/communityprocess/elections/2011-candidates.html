<p>
The competition is intense for this year�s election of new and incumbent candidates to the Java Community Process (JCP) program�s Executive Committee (EC). Only a few seats are open, and the candidates are eager and willing to serve in this capacity. 
</p>

<p>
Besides wanting to influence technology standards for the future, many of the candidates expressed a goal to participate in the next steps for revising the JCP constitution. In particular, they want to oversee the planned merger of the Micro Edition (ME) and the Java Standard Edition/Enterprise Edition (SE/EE) Executive Committees. Some even relish the prospect of revising the Java Specification Participation Agreement (JSPA). 
</p>

<p>
Ongoing Executive Committee functions are listing on the <a href="/en/participation/committee">EC participation page</a>, each EC Member is expected to:
<ul>
	<li>Select Java Specification Requests (JSRs) for development within the JCP.</li>
	<li>Approve draft Specifications for Public Review.</li>
	<li>Give final approval to completed Specifications and their associated Reference Implementations (RIs) and Technology Compatibility Kits (TCKs).</li>
	<li>Decide appeals of first-level TCK test challenges.</li>
	<li>Review maintenance revisions and possibly require some to be carried out in a new JSR.</li>
	<li>Approve transfer of maintenance duties between Members.</li>
	<li>Provide guidance to the Program Management Office (PMO).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Fulfilling these kinds of duties includes attendance. Because the EC operates in an open, transparent manner, incumbent candidates have a <a href="/en/participation/attendance">track record</a> of participation in the EC meetings, which might offer additional insights into their potential influence and effectiveness. 
</p>

<p>
And now, meet the candidates:

<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">IBM</span> has contributed to the Java Community, influencing almost every aspect of the platform's evolution over the years since 1996. The company has been a key participant and leader on numerous JSRs since 1998, and a contributing member on both Executive Committees since their inception in 2000. By making Java-dependent hardware and software, IBM is investing heavily in the success of Java technology. In the Java ME space, IBM provides VM ports to more than twenty environments, together with support for a broad range of configurations, profiles, and JSRs. IBM has contributed significantly to the API specifications of the Java ME, SE, and EE platforms, as well as in numerous other Java specifications such as the Java Foundation Classes, Accessibility APIs, and improving internationalization support in Java. IBM has the distinction of having served as Spec Lead on JSR 1. In total, IBM is Spec Lead on three J2ME JSRs, and participates in seventeen J2ME JSR Expert Groups, including those related to CDC and modularity. IBM was nominated for the JCP Member of the Year award for 2004 and 2011, and in 2008 won Most Outstanding Java SE/EE Spec Lead for work on JSR 286.

Six months ago, Alex was elected to an ME EC seat that had vacated, and he participated in JSR 348, Towards a New Version of the Java Community Process. Alex is interested in Kinect, JavaFX, Java TV, and Java ME on mobile phones and embedded systems. Before joining the EC, he used Java ME on feature phones to deliver behavior modification programs, funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Alex has realized that Java ME is very powerful and can run effectively on embedded devices; he wants to help �evangelize Java on embedded� and make a strong contribution to �Moving Java Forward.� He coauthored <i>Java Media APIs: Cross-Platform Imaging, Media, and Visualization</i> on Java 3D, Java Advanced Imaging, and the Java Media Framework. Through his VR research at NIH, Alex used Java3D to control the presentation of 3D and VR stimuli, and he used Java3D environments in a functional MRI scanner. Alex�s career has focused on technology development based on brain science (e.g., computer vision, neural networks, and information theory). He holds a PhD in Psychology and Neural Systems from the University of Arizona. 
<br><br>
Although Alex is running for the ME EC seat as an individual, his current work title is Vice President of Innovation at the Nielsen Company, a corporation that does not inhabit the Java space. Having been an executive, entrepreneur, and academic, Alex offers a multi-faceted perspective to the ME EC. Alex is determined to simplify �the evil JSPA� to reduce barriers for joining the JCP program. In his position paper, Alex said, �there are some good ways to break up the JSPA into components that can be passed incrementally. �[W]e should insist on plain English translation of the legal terms using boxes that describe what the text means�. [W]e should include use cases and examples from the real world to describe how the JSPA relates to different entities. I propose that we rewrite the JSPA in three deliverables�member, Expert Group member, and Spec Lead.�
