<br>

<p><strong>Supporting this JSR:</strong> 
</p>
<p>All members of the JCP Executive Committees support this JSR.

<br><br>
<h2 class="western">Section 2: Request</h2>

<h4 class="western">2.1 Please describe the proposed Specification:</h4>
<p>This JSR will make changes to the Process Document and potentially
also to the Executive Committee's Standing Rules with the goals of
further improving the organization's processes, correcting problems
that have become apparent over recent years, and clarifying language
to reduce ambiguity.</p>

<h4 class="western">2.2 What is the target Java platform? (i.e.,
desktop, server, personal, embedded, card, etc.)</h4>
<p>The updated version of the Process Document will apply to all new
JSRs commenced after its completion and to future Maintenance
Releases of existing JSRs. The Executive Committee intends to
strongly encourage - though it cannot require - that it should also
be adopted by in-progress JSRs. 
</p>

<h4 class=western">2.3 The Executive Committees would like to ensure JSR
submitters think about how their proposed technology relates to all
of the Java platform editions. Please provide details here for which
platform editions are being targeted by this JSR, and how this JSR
has considered the relationship with the other platform editions.</h4>

<p>This JSR will address all Java platform editions.</p>

<h4 class="western">2.4 What need of the Java community will be
addressed by the proposed specification?</h4>

<p>
<a href="/en/jsr/detail.id=358">JSR 358</a> was
intended to perform a complete overhaul of the JCP's processes and
its legal foundations as defined in the JSPA. On learning that we
would be unable to modify the JSPA at this time, we withdrew that JSR
with the intent of taking up its content again at a future date. We
propose in this JSR to take up some of those JSR 358 changes that can
be implemented simply by modifying the Process Document.

<p>
The primary focus of the JSR will be on collaborative reference
implementation (RI) development, with the goal of ensuring that none
of the JCP's processes inhibit collaborative development processes. 
The JSR will implement changes that will build on the reforms that
began with JSR 348 and continued with JSR 364, making the work of the
JCP more open and transparent, and enabling broad participation.

<p>Items for discussion include:</p>

Potential language around collaborative RI development.

<p>
Potential changes to the stages of a JSR lifecycle as a result of the
collaborative development process (see section 3.4 of Process
document) and consider potential for multiple final releases of a
JSR.<br>

<p>
- Add language that Spec Leads should provide access to the TCK to JSR
Expert Group Members and Contributors for examination purposes only.<br>
- Add language that Spec Leads should specify Terms of Use for their
JSR collaboration projects that comply with the JSPA.<br>
- Possible modifications to Renewal Ballots, specifically for Dormant JSRs.

<p>
Potential changes to the Maintenance process:<br>

<p>
- Maintenance Lead specify at Maintenance Release whether future changes are expected.<br>
- End of Life for JSRs.<br>
- Expert Group dissolution at Final Release.<br>
- Ease the transition of a JSR from one Sped Lead to another.<br>
- Addition of an Errata process.

<p>
Add language that allows free redistribution of the Process Document.

<p>
Clarify JSR voting rules for EC members.

<h4 class="western">2.5 Why isn't this need met by existing specifications?</h4>
<p>See above. 

<h4 class="western">2.6 Please give a short description of the
underlying technology or technologies:</h4>
<p>Not applicable. 

<h4 class="western">2.7 Is there a proposed package name for the API
Specification? (i.e., javapi.something, org.something, etc.)</h4>
<p>Not applicable. 

<h4 class="western">2.8 Does the proposed specification have any
dependencies on specific operating systems, CPUs, or I/O devices that
you know of?</h4>
<p>Not applicable.</p>

<h4 class="western">2.9 Are there any security issues that cannot be
addressed by the current security model?</h4>
<p>Not applicable.</p>

<h4 class="western">2.10 Are there any internationalization or
localization issues?</h4>
<p>Not applicable.</p>

<h4 class="western">2.11 Are there any existing specifications that
might be rendered obsolete, deprecated, or in need of revision as a
result of this work?</h4>
<p>This JSR will produce new versions of the JCP Process document and
(if necessary) the EC Standing Rules. As explained in section 2.2 the
new version of the Process Document will not replace the existing one
but they will <em>deprecate</em> it. Any new version of the Standing
Rules will immediately replace the existing version.</p>
<h4 class="western">2.12 Please describe the anticipated schedule for
the development of this specification.</h4>

<p>
<strong>JSR submittal: </strong>May 2017<br>
<strong>Early Draft Review: </strong>September 2017<br>
<strong>Public Draft Review: </strong>January 2018<br>
<strong>Proposed Final Draft: </strong>May 2018<br>
<strong>Final Approval Ballot: </strong>June 2018

<h4 class="western">2.13 Please describe the anticipated working model for the Expert Group working on developing this specification.</h4>
<p>
The EC will form the Expert Group for this JSR. The Chair of the JCP 
will act as Spec Lead and the PMO will provide administrative
assistance as necessary. In addition to working on this JSR during
regularly-scheduled EC meetings, additional teleconferences will be
scheduled as necessary. Since it is likely that only a subset of EC
members will attend these additional meetings, their results will be
reported back to the full Executive Committees for review and
approval. In addition to teleconferences and face-to-face meetings,
the Expert Group will make extensive use of email and collaborative
tools such a Wiki and issue-tracker, as explained in the next
section. 

<h4 class="western">2.14 Provide detailed answers to the transparency checklist, making sure to include URLs as appropriate:</h4>
<p>A GitHub project will host all communication mechanisms. The
home-page of this project will contain pointers to the mailing-lists,
Wiki, document archive, discussion forum, and issue tracker, and will
explain how members of the public can observe and participate in the
activities of the Expert Group. 
</p>
<p>- Is the schedule for the JSR publicly available, current, and
updated regularly? 
</p>
<p>The document archive will contain a copy of the schedule, which
will be updated as necessary. 
</p>
<p>- Can the public read and/or write to a wiki for the JSR? 
</p>
<p>We will use the Wiki as a one-way channel of communication (from
the EG to the public.) The public will be able to read all our
documents, and to respond with comments via the public mailing-list. 
</p>
<p>- Is there a publicly accessible discussion board for the JSR that
you read and respond to regularly? 
</p>
<p>We will provide a discussion forum, but the experience of earlier
JCP.next JSRs suggests that the public would prefer to use a
mailing-list: https://groups.io/g/jcp. 
</p>
<p>- Have you spoken at conferences and events about the JSR
recently? 
</p>
<p>Not yet, but as with previous JCP.next JSRs this will be a major
topic whenever members of the PMO speak at conferences and meet with
Java User Groups. 
</p>
<p>- Are you using open-source processes for the development of the
RI and/or the TCK? 
</p>
<p>Not applicable. 
</p>
<p>- What are the Terms of Use required to use the collaboration
tools you have prepared to use with the Expert Group, so that
prospective EG members can judge whether they are compatible with the
JSPA? 
</p>
<p>The standard GitHub Terms of Use will apply. 
</p>
<p>- Does the Community tab for my JSR have links to and information
about all public communication mechanisms and sites for the
development of my JSR? 
</p>
<p>It will point to the project home-page for the JSR, which will in
turn provide all necessary information about the communication
mechanisms used by the Expert Group. 
</p>
<h4 class="western">2.15 Please describe how the RI and TCK will de
delivered, i.e. as part of a profile or platform edition, or
stand-alone, or both. Include version information for the profile or platform in your answer.</h4>

<p>Since this is a Process-change JSR no RI will be produced.
However, according to the requirements of JCP 2.10 a <em>JSR Review
and Evaluation form</em> will be developed. This form will enable the
EC to verify that new requirements specified in the Process Document
have been implemented correctly.</p>

<h4 class="western">2.16 Please state the rationale if previous
versions are available stand-alone and you are now proposing in 2.13
to only deliver RI and TCK as part of a profile or platform edition
(See sections 1.1.5 and 1.1.6 of the JCP 2 document). 
</h4>
<p>Not applicable. 

<h4 class="western">2.17 Please provide a description of the business
terms for the Specification, RI and TCK that will apply when this JSR
is final.</h4>
<p>Not applicable. 
</p>
<h4 class="western">2.18 Please describe the communications channel
you have established for the public to observe Expert Group
deliberations, provide feedback, and view archives of all Expert
Group communications.</h4>

<p>The Expert Group will conduct business on a public mailing list. 

<h4 class="western">2.19 What is the URL of the Issue Tracker that
the public can read, and how does the public log issues in the Issue
Tracker?</h4>
<p>A GitHub issue tracker will be used. The public will be able to
log issues directly into the issue-tracker. 
</p>
<p><strong>2.20 Please provide the location of the publicly
accessible document archive you have created for the Expert Group.</strong></p>
<p>All documents will be archived on the JSR GitHub project page. 

<br><br>
<h2 class="western">Section 3: Contributions</h2>

<h4 class="western">3.1 Please list any existing documents,
specifications, or implementations that describe the technology.
Please include links to the documents if they are publicly available.</h4>
