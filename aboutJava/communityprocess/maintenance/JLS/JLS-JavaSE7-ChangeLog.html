<h2>Maintenance Review of JSR 901 (Java<sup>TM</sup> Language Specification) for Java SE 7</h2>

<p><em>Last updated 2011-03-18 by Alex Buckley</em></p>

<p>The clarifications and amendments below are proposed to
the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/otndocs/jcp/jsr901-mrel2-spec/">Java
Language Specification, Third Edition</a>.</p>

<p>The complete amended specification is the Java Language
Specification, <em>Java SE 7 Edition</em>. (The next edition of the
Java Virtual Machine Specification will also be known as the <em>Java
SE 7 Edition</em>.)</p>

<p>As features are added to the Java language, the Java Language
Specification grows longer and more complex. Features must be
introduced, specified, exemplified, discussed, and interwoven with
existing features. The Technology Compatibility Kit for the Java
language must be updated too, as per
the <a href="http://jcp.org/en/procedures/jcp2">Java Community
Process</a>. To maintain readability and to support testability, it is
desirable for the Java Language Specification to strongly
differentiate normative material from informative material. For
example, the compile-time errors possible for a field declaration are
normative, but the conventional order of modifiers in a field
declaration is informative. As another example, the rules of definite
assignment are normative but an extended discussion of source code to
show subtleties of the rules is informative.</p>

<p>As a result, there are two versions available of the Java Language
Specification, Java SE 7 Edition:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://download.oracle.com/otndocs/jcp/jls-7-mr3-normv-oth-JSpec/">The
    normative version</a> (382 pages) contains only the syntax,
    definitions, and rules of the Java programming language, without
    examples or discussion.</li>
  <li><a href="http://download.oracle.com/otndocs/jcp/jls-7-mr3-fullv-oth-JSpec/">The
    full version</a> (586 pages) is the text of the normative version
    plus inline examples and discussion, as was the style in the Third
    Edition.</li>
</ul>

<p>In both versions, red text is new in the Java SE 7 Edition; blue
text is changed with respect to the Third Edition.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Clarifications and Amendments to the Java Language Specification, Third Edition</h3>

<h4>Organization of the Specification</h4>

<h5>Normative material</h5>

<p>Cross-cutting rules concerning variable declarations have been
centralized, rather than continuing to be spread throughout the
Specification wherever a declaration of some kind of variable was
discussed. Namely, the rules for scope, shadowing, mixed array
notation, and exception checking are centralized in 6.3, 6.4.1, 10.2,
and 11.2.3, and moreover are not duplicated in other
sections. Informative text in other sections refers to the central
definitions.</p>

<p>4.5.1.1 Type Argument Containment and 4.12.2.1 Heap Pollution have
been incorporated into their immediately preceding sections.</p>

<p>5.5 Casting Conversion has been split into four sections for
clarity.</p>

<p>7.4.4 Scope of a Package Declaration has been removed (in line with
the centralization theme discussed later), and its material
incorporated into 6.3 Scope and 6.4.1 Shadowing.</p>

<p>7.5.5 Automatic Imports has been removed, and its material
incorporated into 7.3 Compilation Units (which it essentially
duplicated already).</p>

<p>8.9 Enums has been given two subsections for clarity.</p>

<p>9.1.5 Access to Interface Member Names has been removed, since its
point about implicitly public members is duplicated in 9.3, 9.4, and
9.5.</p>

<p>9.6 Annotation Types has been given two additional subsections for
clarity. This has resulted in 9.6.1 Predefined Annotation Types
shifting down to 9.6.3.</p>

<p>11.3.1 Exceptions are Precise has been incorporated into 11.3
Run-Time Handling of an Exception. 11.3.2 Handling Asynchronous
Exceptions has been moved to 11.1. 11.5 The Exception Hierarchy mainly
mirrored observations on exception types in 11.1 and 11.2, so has been
removed and its material incorporated into those sections.</p>

<p>15.8.1.1 String Conversion has been moved to 5.1.11.</p>

<p>17.8 Wait Sets and Notification and 17.9 Sleep and Yield have been
moved to 17.2 and 17.3 respectively. (See below for the original
17.3.)</p>

<h5>Informative material</h5>

<p>It is desirable to keep section numbering consistent between the
normative and full versions of the Specification, which means that
example-only sections are not possible. As a result, example-only
sections have been removed. Most were the last section at their level,
so this one-time change has not affected broader section numbering
(except in minor ways in chapters 10, 11, and 17). The examples have
been added as informative material in closely related sections. The
removed sections are:</p>

<pre>
6.6.3 An Example of Access Control
6.6.4 Example: Access to public and Non-public Classes
6.6.5 Example: Default-Access Fields, Methods, and Constructors
6.6.6 Example: public Fields, Methods, and Constructors
6.6.7 Example: protected Fields, Methods, and Constructors
6.6.8 Example: private Fields, Methods, and Constructors
7.5.6 A Strange Example
8.2.1 Examples of Inheritance
8.3.3 Examples of Field Declarations
8.4.10 Examples of Method Declarations
9.3.2 Examples of Field Declarations
9.4.3 Examples of Abstract Method Declarations
10.5 Arrays: A Simple Example
11.4 An Example of Exceptions
15.12.2.9 Examples
15.12.2.10 Example: Overloading Ambiguity
15.12.2.11 Example: Return Type Not Considered
15.12.2.12 Example: Compile-Time Resolution
15.13.2 Examples: Array Access Evaluation Order
15.18.1.3 Examples of String Concatenation
17.3 Incorrectly Synchronized Programs Exhibit Surprising Behaviors
</pre>

<p>6.4 Members and Inheritance appeared normative, but in fact merely
duplicated many normative statements of chapters 7-10, as well as
re-describing properties of packages and reference types implied by
those chapters. A small amount of informative material from 6.4 has
been incorporated into 7.1, 8.2, and 9.2 to improve readability; the
rest of 6.4 has been deleted. 6.4 now contains the definitions of
shadowing and obscuring formerly found in 6.3.1 and 6.3.2.</p>

<p>6.8 Naming Conventions and 7.7 Unique Package Names were entirely
informative, and have been incorporated as informative material into
6.1 Declarations and 6.4 Shadowing and Obscuring.</p>

<p>7.4.1.1 Package Annotations was mainly informative, so 7.4.1.1 has
been removed and all its material incorporated into 7.4.1 Named
Packages.</p>

<p>Exploiting the ability to give more discussion without cluttering
the normative version of the Specification, there are new discussions
in 4.8 Raw Types, 6.6 Access Control, and 15.8 Primary Expressions
that clarify some long-held principles of the Java language.</p>



<h4>Proposed changes, by chapter</h4>

<p>Defects in the Java Language Specification are tracked as bugs in
the <code>java:specification</code> category of
the <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/">Java Bug
Database</a>. The list below gives the ID and synopsis for each bug
whose evaluation proposes a clarification or amendment to the Java
Language Specification, Third Edition.</p>

<p>Some defects in the Java Language Specification are related to
defects in <code>javac</code>, the Reference Implementation of a
compiler for the Java language. Bugs for compiler defects are tracked
in the <code>java:compiler</code> category. If a specification bug is
strongly related to a compiler bug, then the compiler bug is listed
below the specification bug for completeness, indented and entirely
surrounded by [ ].</p>

<p>Occasionally, a compiler bug proposes a change in the Java Language
Specification and it is more convenient to record the change in the
compiler bug rather than creating a separate specification
bug. Consequently, a few specification bugs below are actually in
the <code>java:compiler</code> category, and are identified by [ ]
around the synopsis.</p>

<p>In addition to the bugs below, <code>7029127 Public comments on
JLS3</code> records proposed changes due to comments sent between 2006
and 2011 from members of the public to the Maintenance Lead of JSR 901

</pre>

<p>JLS3 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 4.12.2: Terminology has been tightened around
generics, such as the difference between type variables, type
parameters (not "formal type parameters"), and type arguments. The
conditions for unchecked warnings, and terminology around heap
pollution, have been clarified.<p>

<p>JLS3 6.5.6.1, 6.5.6.2, 15.14, 15.15: The meaning of names and final
variables has been clarified.</p>

<p>JLS3 5.1.3: Added: "Conversion of a double value to float is
governed by the IEEE 754 rounding rules (4.2.4). This conversion can
lose precision, but also lose range, resulting in a float zero from a
nonzero double and a float infinity from a finite double. A double NaN
is converted to a float NaN and a double infinity is converted to the
same-signed float infinity."</p>

<p>JLS3 5.1.7, 5.1.8: Boxing and unboxing conversion is specified to
occur on values, but obviously works on variables too.</p>

<p>JLS3 8.9.2: An explicit constructor declaration of an enum type
must not be public or protected.</p>

<p>JLS3 10.1: References to "component type" throughout the spec (but
especially in 10.1 Array Types) have been changed to "element type",
sometimes for correctness and sometimes for readability.</p>

<p>JLS3 13.4.12: Changed: "Adding a method ... will not break
compatibility with any pre-existing binaries, ***even*** in the case
where..." (The word "even" was in JLS1 to subtly point out that Java
does not suffer from fragile base classes. JLS2/3 dropped the word
"even", but that made informative text appear like an important
normative side-condition. It isn't; the word "even" is an important
break to indicate an interesting, but ultimately unsurprisingly,
informative sidebar.)</p>

<p>JLS3 13.4.14: Changing the type of the last formal parameter of a
method from T[] to T... is binary-compatible. (And source-compatible,
since old clients which pass a T[] can be recompiled against the
changed method declaration, thanks to 8.4.2's definition of T... as
T[].)</p>

<p>JLS3 15.12.2.1: A redundant rule about arity of a potentially
applicable member has been removed.</p>

<p>JLS3 15.16: An extra [] in a primitive type cast were erroneously
allowed (compare with the copy in 15.15), even though these were
technically not part of the target type in the subsequent normative
text.</p>

<p>JLS3 17.4.8: Well formed executions E_i,... should not mention
O_i.</p>
