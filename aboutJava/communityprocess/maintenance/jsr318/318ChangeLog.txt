1. (Errata)  Correction to the error in javadocs for the javax.ejb.spi.EJBContainerProvider createEJBContainer method.  The correct name of the referenced property is javax.ejb.embeddable.provider.  See http://wiki.jcp.org/boards/index.php?t=4468

2. (Errata)  Correction to the error in the value of the serialVersionUID field of the javax.ejb.CreateException.  The correct value is 6295951740865457514L.  See https://glassfish.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=12450

3. (Enhancement) Improvement to the level of detail of the javadoc documentation to better reflect the content of the specification document as requested by members of the community.  Documentation for a number of methods added in the EJB 3.1 release is currently missing.  This does not entail any semantic change to the specification.  See https://glassfish.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=11247
