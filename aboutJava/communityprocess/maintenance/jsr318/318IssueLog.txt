ISSUE #1

[The following was posted by Andrew Rubinger to jsr-318-public]

Hi EG:

While implementing EJBContainer for JBoss I've come across:
http://java.sun.com/javaee/6/docs/api/javax/ejb/spi/EJBContainerProvider.html#createEJBContainer(java.util.Map)
Which states:
"...The javax.ejb.embeddable.initial property was included in the Map passed to createEJBContainer and the value of the property is the provider's implementation class..."
I believe this conflicts with:
http://java.sun.com/javaee/6/docs/api/constant-values.html#javax.ejb.embeddable.EJBContainer.PROVIDER
Which notes: "javax.ejb.embeddable.provider"
Could the group please confirm, and if necessary, adjust the JavaDoc in the next revision?


RATIONALE FOR CHANGE:

This is a bug in the javadoc documentation for the given method.
The specification and RI both have the correct name for this property,
namely javax.ejb.embeddable.provider, which was the name agreed upon
by the EJB 3.1 Expert Group.

ISSUE #2

[The following was posted as a bug to glassfish.dev.java.net
https://glassfish.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=12450]

Summary:  	SerialVersion UID for javax.ejb.CreateException

The SerialVersionUID  for CreateException  in GF 3.0.1 was incorrectly set to
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 7899534274371798660L;
But this value is wrong as for Java EE 5 the value was (via serialver):
serialver -classpath javaee.jar javax.ejb.CreateException
javax.ejb.CreateException:    static final long serialVersionUID = 6295951740865457514L;
This is causing interop failures in certain cases.
The EJB classes which were serializable had their SerialVersionUID added but it appears the wrong value was added to javax.ejb.CreateException


RATIONALE FOR CHANGE:

This is a bug in the CreateException file which resulted from a cut-and-paste
error, as the value for the CreateException was copied from the value of
the ConcurrentAccessTimeoutException.  The correct value, as agreed upon
by the EJB 3.1 Expert Group is 6295951740865457514L.

Summary:  	Add examples to java docs in javax.ejb

( I will ask the questions someone reading the Java-Doc may ask)

1) http://java.sun.com/javaee/6/docs/api/javax/ejb/Schedule.html

hour is a String (is this 24 hour, 12 hour, should I put AM after the hour ?, I
know I can * etc, what else ?)
info is a String , what is that ?
timezone is a String , what is that ?
month is a String , can this be 1, Jan, January, jan etc ?
day is a String, I know it can't be Thur, it must be Thu ( I only found this out by trial and error)


Some examples like 'man contab' would be great :

       # MIN HOUR DAY MONTH DAYOFWEEK   COMMAND
       # at 6:10 a.m. every day
       10 6 * * * date

       # every two hours at the top of the hour
       0 */2 * * * date

       # every two hours from 11p.m. to 7a.m., and at 8a.m.
       0 23-7/2,8 * * * date

       # at 11:00 a.m. on the 4th and on every mon, tue, wed
       0 11 4 * mon-wed date

       # 4:00 a.m. on january 1st
       0 4 1 jan * date


2) http://java.sun.com/javaee/6/docs/api/javax/ejb/ScheduleExpression.html
 
ScheduleExpression ScheduleExpression::end(java.util.Date e) , what is that, how
do I use this ? Why does it return another instance of ScheduleExpression ?
Should this be static ?

ScheduleExpression second(int s), what is that ? Why does it return another
instance of ScheduleExpression ? Should this be static ?

etc.

There are some great docs here :

The fix to this issue requires a change to the code from which this
documentation is generated. Therefore, I have changed the subcomponent from docs
to the subcomponent that includes the affected code.

Once specification is approved, it will take an MR to update java doc. Excluding from v3 defect tracking.

Linda is working on it


RATIONALE FOR CHANGE:

The javadoc documentation for some of the new features added in EJB
3.1 are quite lacking, resulting in the need for developers to search
out the missing information in the specification document itself (not
always an easy task).  This is a usability issue for members of the
Java EE community.
