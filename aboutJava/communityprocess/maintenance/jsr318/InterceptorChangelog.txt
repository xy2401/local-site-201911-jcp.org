Clarified Section 1.2 to be consistent with the Java EE Platform
specification with regard to when interceptors defined by means of the
Interceptors annotation and interceptors defined by means of
interceptor bindings are required to be supported.

Clarified terminology in sections 2.1 and 2.2.

Noted that around-construct interceptors run in the same thread as the
target constructor in section 2.3.1.

Clarified that around-construct interceptor methods may throw checked exceptions.

Clarified distinction between core requirements and the latitude
available to extension specifications.

Reworded to indicate that deployment descriptors are specific to
extension specifications.

Clarified that interceptor binding may not be used to associate
interceptors with decorators.

Corrected bug in section 3.1.1: An interceptor binding type can only
be applied to an interceptor binding type defining a subset of its
target types.

Removed inconsistency whereby only around-construct lifecycle callback
interceptors could declare interceptor binding types defined other
than as Target(TYPE).

Clarified when Priority annotation is ignored.

Added section 5.1, "Enabling Interceptors" to Chapter 5, "Interceptor
Ordering" to centralize existing requirements on enabling interceptors
and separate concept of the enabling of interceptors from the ordering
of interceptors.

Combined interceptor ordering rules into a single algorithm in section 5.2.

Factored out section 5.3 on excluding interceptors.

Clarified that ExcludeClassInterceptors applies only to interceptors
defined by means of the Interceptors annotation.

Made numerous editorial cleanup changes, and reorganized document for clarity.

Made minor updates to the javadoc files to more completely reflect the
contents of spec.
