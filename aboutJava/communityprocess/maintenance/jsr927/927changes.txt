Proposed Changes for Java TV 1.1 Maintenance Release
----------------------------------------------------
Declare Java TV 1.1 an Java ME optional package, compatible with Personal Basis Profile 1.0 and later.

Remove the unused packages javax.tv.carousel and javax.tv.media.protocol.

Incorporate APIs from Java Media Framework 1.0, previously required by Java TV 1.0.

Apply MHP errata against Java TV 1.0 and JMF 1.0, as listed in MHP 1.0.3 Section A.

Apply agreed solutions to MHP corrigenda against Java TV 1.0.

Make the JMF event/listener model follow the JDK 1.1 model, per the directives of the JMF 1.0 spec.  Thus:

  - ControllerListener, GainChangeListener: Change to extend java.util.EventListener.

  - ControllerEvent, GainChangeEvent : Change to extend java.util.EventObject.

  - MediaEvent : Remove reference to sunw.util.EventObject.
