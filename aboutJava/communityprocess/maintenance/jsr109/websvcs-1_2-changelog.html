<h1>Change Log: JSR-109 : Web Services for Java EE, Version 1.2</h1>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Maintainance Review for JSR-109 Web Services for Java EE, Version
1.2</p>
<h3>Maintainance Lead</h3>
<p>Dhiru Pandey, Sun Microsystems, Inc.</p>
<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>Comments should be sent to <a href="jsr109-spec-comments@sun.com">jsr109-spec-comments@sun.com</a></p>
<h3>Rationale for proposed changes</h3>
<p>The main goal of this maintainance release is to align JSR-109 to
the latest Web Services specification i.e. JAX-WS 2.0
(<a href="/en/jsr/detail?id=224">http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=224</a>)
and to fix bugs/inconsistencies in the previous version of the
specification. From the specification perspective, these changes are
minimal and targeted solely to fulfill the above stated goals.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h1>Proposed Changes</h1>
<p>The changes to the specification are listed below.</p>
<p>Each change is numbered for ease of reference.</p>
<p>The actual verbiage for most of the changes can be found in the
attached specification draft (with change bars) at the section (or
sections) mentioned below.</p>
<h2>1.0 Java EE name change</h2>
<p>Relevant occurances of J2EE in the entire 109 specification were
changed to Java EE</p>
<h2>2.0 JAX-WS changes</h2>
<p>Relevant occurances of JAX-RPC in the entire specification were
changed to add JAX-WS to it. This was done to reflect that the 109
specification now also supports JAX-WS which is a follow-on
specification to JAX-RPC</p>
<h2>3.0 SOAP 1.2 changes</h2>
<p>Relevant occurances of SOAP 1.1 in the entire specification were
changed to add SOAP 1.2 to it. This was done to reflect that this
specification now also supports SOAP 1.2 via JAX-WS specification</p>
<h2>4.0 Client side changes</h2>
<h3>4.1 Added support for client side annotation to access Web Service
(Section 4.2.2)</h3>
<p>JSR-109 will require the use of @WebServiceRef annotation with
JAX-WS runtime to access a Web Service from the client.</p>
<h3>4.2 Changes to support javax.xml.ws.Service Class in JAX-WS
(Section
4.2.3)</h3>
<p>Service Interface in JAX-RPC was changed to Service Class in
JAX-WS. The resulting API changes are documented in this section.</p>
<h3>4.3 Changes for JAX-WS properties (Section 4.2.5)</h3>
<p>Some security and endpoint address related properties were renamed
in JAX-WS. They are documented here.</p>
<h3>4.4 Use of javax.xml.ws.Dispatch APIs (Section 4.2.6)</h3>
<p>JAX-WS introduces new client side javax.xml.ws.Dispatch APIs. This
is a low level API that requires clients to construct messages or
message payloads as XML and requires an intimate knowledge of the
desired message or payload structure. This is useful in those
situations where the client wants to operate at the XML message
level. Added section 4.2.6 to allow the use of Dispatch APIs on the
client side</p>
<h3>4.5 Support for JAX-WS Asynchronous operations (Section 4.2.7)</h3>
<p>JAX-WS supports two forms of asynchronous invocations ��� Polling
and Callback. This section was added in the specification to allow
usage of both Polling and Callback mechanisms of JAX-WS. Polling
invocations are allowed from both within EJBs and Servlets, but
Callback invocations are only allowed from Servlets.</p>
<h3>4.6 Support for OASIS XML Catalogs specification (Section 4.2.9)</h3>
<p>This section on packaging was changed to allow support for OASIS
XML Catalogs 1.1 specification</p>
<h2>5.0 Server side changes</h2>
<h3>5.1 Clarification on use of Service Endpoint Interface with JAX-WS
(Section 5.3.1)</h3>
<p>This section was changed to document that the Service Endpoint
Interface (SEI) is no longer required to be provided by the port
component developer when JAX-WS is being used.</p>
<h3>5.2 Added support for @WebService annotation on Service
Implementation Bean (Section 5.3.2.1)</h3>
<p>This section was added to detail support for @WebService
annotation on Service Implementation Bean. It also provides
information on the relationship of the member attributes of this
annotation and the deployment descriptor elements.</p>
<h3>5.3 Added support for @WebServiceProvider annotation on Service
Implementation Bean (Section 5.3.2.2)</h3>
<p>This section was added to detail support for javax.xml.ws.Provider
interface and @WebServiceProvider annotation on Service
Implementation Bean. It also provides information on the relationship
of the member attributes of this annotation and the deployment
descriptor elements.</p>
<h3>5.4 Changes in EJB container programming model (Section 5.2.3.3)</h3>
<p>This section was changed to add requirements for creating a
Service Implementation Bean as a Stateless EJB when using a JAX-WS
based container. It also documents the use of @Stateless annotation
from EJB 3.0 specification and lifecyle callback annotations
(@PostConstruct and @PreDestroy) from JSR-250 (Common Annotation for
Java Platform)</p>
<h3>5.5 Web container programming model for JAX-WS (Section 5.3.2.4.2)</h3>
<p>This section was added to provide details on Web container
programming model for JAX-WS based containers. The programming model
is similar to JAX-RPC. It also documents the use of lifecyle callback
annotations (@PostConstruct and @PreDestroy) from JSR-250 (Common
Annotation for Java Platform) used in JAX-WS.</p>
<h3>5.6 Added support for specifying protocol binding (Section 5.3.5)</h3>
<p>A JAX-WS implementation must provide support for SOAP1.2/HTTP,
SOAP1.1/HTTP and XML/HTTP protocol bindings. It also requires that a
JAX-WS implementation provide a facility for the developer to specify
the binding. This section was added to support this requirement from
JAX-WS.</p>
<h3>5.7 Added support for enabling/disabling MTOM/XOP (Section 5.3.6)</h3>
<p>JAX-WS compliant implementations are required to support MTOM/XOP
specification from W3C. This section was added to provide support for
this requirement from JAX-WS.</p>
<h3>5.8 Added support for Catalog packaging (Section 5.4.4)</h3>
<p>This section on packaging was added to allow support for OASIS XML
Catalogs 1.1 specification required by JAX-WS</p>
<h2>6.0 Handler related changes</h2>
<h3>6.1 Changes in Concepts (Section 6.1)</h3>
<p>Added some explanation for Logical and Protocol Handlers in JAX-WS</p>
<h3>6.2 Changes in Programming Model (Section 6.2.2)</h3>
<p>Added a paragraph on HandlerResolver interface of JAX-WS</p>
<h3>6.3 Added new section on Handler Lifecycle with JAX-WS (Section
6.2.2.2)</h3>
<p>This section was added to show the differences in the lifecycle of
Handlers in JAX-WS. Detailed the usage of lifecycle callback
annotations @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy.</p>
<h3>6.4 Added new section on @HandlerChain annotation (Section 6.2.2.3)</h3>
<p>This section details the use of this annotation and also talks
about the HandlerResolver interface of JAX-WS</p>
<h3>6.5 Clarification in section on Security (Section 6.2.2.4)</h3>
<p>Changed the following paragraph here:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79in;">���A Handler must not change the
message in any way that would cause the previously executed
authorization check to execute differently. A Handler.handleRequest()
method must not change the operation name, number of parts in the
message, or types of the message parts. A container must throw a SOAP
fault with a faultcode of soap-env:Server (the namespace identifier
for the namespace prefix, soap-env:, is
http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/) back to the client if the
Handler does this. Although, not strictly required for security
reasons, a Handler.handleResponse() method should not change the
number of parts in the message, or types of the message parts. A
container should log occurrences of these errors since the client may
not be expecting a response (i.e. it may be a one-way invocation).���</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79in;">TO</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79in;">���A Handler must not change the
message in any way that would cause the previously executed
authorization check to execute differently. ���</p>
<p>The deleted part of this paragraph is very hard to test and also
enforcing this would have significant performance implications.
Essentially, what is really required here are the constraints on a
handler so that the security checks are executed correctly. The same
deletion was also made to the Response part of this section where the
language is used is similar and again very hard to test and also
enforcing this would have significant performance implications.</p>
<h3>6.6 Changes in section on Developer Responsibilities (Section 6.2.3)</h3>
<p>This section was changed to update it for JAX-WS Handler specific
details</p>
<h3>6.7 Changes in section on Container Provider Responsibilities
(Section 6.2.4)</h3>
<p>This section was changed to update it for JAX-WS Handler specific
details</p>
<h3>6.8 Changes in section on Packaging (Section 6.3)</h3>
<p>Added packaging requirements for handler chain file used in
@HandlerChain annotation.</p>
<h2>7.0 Deployment Descriptor changes</h2>
<h3>7.1 Changes in section on server side Developer Responsibilities
(Section 7.1.2)</h3>
<p>Added description of new deployment descriptor elements like
&lt;wsdl-service&gt;, &lt;enable-mtom&gt;, &lt;protocol-binding&gt;,
&lt;handler-chains&gt;. Also clarified that JAX-RPC mapping file is
no longer required when JAX-WS runtime is being used.</p>
<h3>7.2 Changes in section on Web Services Deployment Descriptor XML
Schema (Section 7.1.5)</h3>
<p>Removed the old schema and added new updated server side schema.</p>
<h3>7.3 Changes in section on client side Developer Responsibilities
(Section 7.2.2)</h3>
<p>Clarified that JAX-RPC mapping file is no longer required when
JAX-WS runtime is being used.</p>
<h3>7.4 Changes in section on Web Services Client Service Reference XML
Schema (Section 7.2.5)</h3>
<p>Removed the old schema and added new updated client side schema.</p>
<h3>7.5 Changes in section on JAX-RPC Mapping Deployment Descriptor
(Section 7.3)</h3>
<p>Clarified that the JAX-RPC mapping file is not required in JAX-WS
since it uses JAXB specification for all its data binding needs.</p>
<h3>7.6 Changes in section on Overview of JAX-RPC Mapping Deployment
Descriptor (Section 7.3.1)</h3>
<p>The language in this paragraph was changed for improving clarity
in the specification</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79in;">If the conditions are not met, a full
mapping must be specified. There must be a java-xml-type-mapping for
every root WSDL type. An exception-mapping must be created for each
WSDL fault. There must be a service-interface-mapping for every
service element in the WSDL file that has a Generated Service
Interface used by the developer. There must be a
service-endpoint-interface-mapping for every combination of portType
and binding in the WSDL file. There must be a package-mapping for
every namespace defined in the WSDL file. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79in;">TO:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79in;">If the conditions are not met, a full
mapping must be specified. There must be a java-xml-type-mapping for
every global type definition that is reachable from the port types
(and its attributes like operations, faults, messages etc.) in the
WSDL file.. An exception-mapping must be created for each WSDL fault.
There must be a service-interface-mapping for every service element
in the WSDL file that has a Generated Service Interface used by the
developer. There must be a service-endpoint-interface-mapping for
every combination of portType and binding in the WSDL file. There
must be a package-mapping for every namespace defined in the WSDL
file.</p>
<p>The language in this paragraph was changed for improving clarity
in the specification</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79in;">Web Services for J2EE providers may
support partial mapping specifications (e.g. not providing a
method-param-parts-mapping for every method) regardless of the WSDL
content by using standard JAX-RPC WSDL to Java mapping rules to
resolve the mappings. If mappings are specified, they take precedence

<p style="margin-left: 0.79in;">Web Services for Java EE providers may
support partial mapping specifications (e.g. not providing a
method-param-parts-mapping for every method) regardless of the WSDL
content by using standard JAX-RPC WSDL to Java mapping rules to
resolve the mappings. If mappings are specified, they take precedence
over the mapping rules. Applications that use partial mappings are
therefore non-portable.</p>
