ChangeLog:
1.  Changed the "Client GET Operation Flow" section of the Operation call Javadoc to correctly reflect operation flow.
2.  Added statement to Operation.getResponseCode() to throw an IOException if the Operation object has been closed.
3.  Changed address of Motorola location on cover page.
4.  In section 10.5.1, the last sentence of third paragraph was changed to say that acceptAndOpen() returns a BluetoothConnectionException (and not a BluetoothStateException).  A similar change was made to section 11.3.1.
5.  Clarified section A.6.4 to specify that the service bits must be deactivated, unless other services cocrresponding to those same bits remain active.
6.  Clarified Operation.getResponseCode() to state that it must never return the OBEX CONTINUE response code (0x10 or 0x90).
7.  Updated section 12.7.1 to remove assumption of when the NAME header is sent.
8.  Updated ClientSession put(), get(), setPath(), delete() method descriptions to clarify that null is a valid argument to these methods.
9.  Fixed the default OBEX hint bit in section 12.4.3.2 to 02000 to correctly reflect the default value defined in the OBEX specification.
10. Updated section 11.2.1 and 11.2.1.1 to state that if no receiveMTU is specified, the smaller of the DEFAULT_MTU and the Bluetooth stack max MTU will be used in the MTU negotiation with the remote device.
11. Section A.6.2 made reference to the LocalDevice.getServiceRecord() method.  This is not the correct method name.  Changed it to LocalDevice.getRecord().
12. Changed all references to Appendix C to reference the JSR-82 Javadocs.

Additional Notes:
1.  Kept the bluetooth.api.version and obex.api.version device properties as "1.1" since this release of the specification only clarifies specification issues and does not add or remove features.
