Change Log for JSR 67: Java APIs for XML Messaging 1.0

Description: Changes for SAAJ API 1.4 MR

Maintenance Lead: Lukas Jungmann, Oracle Corporation

Feedback: comments should be sent to spec@saaj.java.net

Proposed changes:
* define JDK 9 module for the SAAJ API to be 'java.xml.soap'
* change the definition of the discovery process of SAAJ implementation
* add generics where applicable
* changed MAY to MUST in javax.xml.soap.SOAPElement.getChildElements methods
* javadoc
   - add @since 1.6 where applicable
   - add missing parameter description
   - add missing exception description
   - add missing return value description
* end of JSR 67 as a standalone technology
     SAAJ API 1.4 will be the last maintenance release of the JSR 67 specification as a standalone technology.
   SAAJ API will continue to be released with the Java API for XML-Based Web Services (JAX-WS) 2.0 JSR,
   but will no longer exist as a standalone technology. Future changes to the SAAJ API will be defined through
   the JAX-WS JSR. The subsumption of SAAJ API into the JAX-WS JSR does not change any mechanisms
   defined in SAAJ API. The interfaces are the same except that they will then be directly specified
   in the JAX-WS JSR. Deployment of alternative implementations of the SAAJ API will continue to be supported.
