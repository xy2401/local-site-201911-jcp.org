JSR-218 (Proposed changes for CDC 1.1.2)
--------

overview.html : Add the following:
"A conformant implementation need only support loopback communication to
the local host.  Network communication to external hosts is not
required.  If an implementation does not support network communication
to external hosts, the system property java.net.isRestricted shall be
set to "true".
If java.net.isRestricted is set to "true", then the APIs of java.net and
java.microedition.io shall throw exceptions as specified (i.e.,
java.io.IOException and subclasses) at any point that external
communication would be required, e.g., resolving a host name or
establishing a connection."

java.util.jar : Fix broken link to "JAR manifest and signature
specification"
