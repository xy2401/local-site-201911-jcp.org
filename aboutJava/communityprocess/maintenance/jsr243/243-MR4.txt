1. Provide a boolean property to serialize access to objects. Add methods to set and clear the property. Add xml metadata to specify the property per class or interface.
2. Provide an API to dynamically create and access metadata equivalent to specifying metadata via annotations or xml.
3. Change the meaning of the validate flag in getObjectById to allow users to
assert that the class of the oid is the exact class of the datastore instance.
4. Add extensions[] to the @Order annotation to mirror the xml.
5. Deprecate the api2-legacy and tck2-legacy projects as these are for use with JDK 1.4 and no longer need to be maintained.
6. Add an API to cancel a running query.
7. Add an API and PMF properties to get and set datastore read and write timeout values.
