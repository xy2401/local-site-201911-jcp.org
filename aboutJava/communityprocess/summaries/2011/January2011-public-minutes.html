<h2>Minutes</h2>
<h3>Personnel changes</h3>
<p>  Patrick reported several personnel changes (see the <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2011-01-1112/PMO-topics-January-2011.pdf">PMO
    presentation</a>) and new members introduced themselves. </p>
<h3>Special election update</h3>
<p>Patrick reported that Oracle is still searching for a suitable corporate nominee.</p>
<h3>EC stats</h3>
<p> Patrick reviewed the <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2011-01-1112/EC_Stats11January2011.pdf">EC
    stats</a> presentation and noted that the four Java SE JSRs had been approved. </p>
<h3>2010 year-end report</h3>
<p>Heather Vancura presented a <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2011-01-1112/2010JCPYearEndSummary.pdf">year-end report</a> on
  the JCP's activities during 2010. Patrick noted that the individual membership
  numbers are inflated since the PMO does not require individual members to &quot;re-commit&quot;
  each year. It was suggested that a nominal yearly membership fee or a requirement
  to renew membership yearly would help to ensure that the numbers are current.
  Patrick responded that the PMO is committed to some such solution. In the context
  of membership numbers someone asked whether Apache had resigned. Patrick reported
  that they had not formally resigned - simply stated their intent not to renew.
  He noted, however, that their renewal would be automatic so they will need
  to take positive steps to resign.</p>
<p>It was noted that Oracle is the Spec Lead for the majority of <em>Active JSRs</em> (26
  out of 46) and also that Oracle fills by far the largest number of Expert Group
  positions (134 out of 900.) Someone asked whether the latter figure was accurate,
  since it would imply that Oracle had approximately three members per Expert
  Group. Heather promised to double-check this figure. It was suggested that
  the number of observers on EG aliases would also be a useful statistic to capture.
  The PMO promised to look into this. </p>
<p>Sean Sheedy asked whether it would be useful to distinguish between <em>Mobile</em>  and <em>Embedded</em> JSRs.
  Roger Riggs pointed out that many JSRs are suitable for both.</p>
<p>In response to a comment that the JSRs that are actively in <em>Maintenance
  Mode</em>  are almost all led by Oracle. John Rizzo responded that Aplix have
  done everything they necessary to release the latest version of JSR 135 (Mobile
  Media API) but the release is being held up by Oracle's lawyers who object
  to the licensing terms. He argued that the license-terms review that the PMO
  carries out before posting releases is undocumented in the Process and amounts
  to an Oracle veto. Don Deutsch and Calinel Pasteanu expressed concerns with
  the Aplix license, pointing out that it does not comply with the requirement
  for Fair Reasonable And Non-Discriminatory terms, and that there is a risk
  that different licenses migh have incompatible (and therefore irreconcilable)
  reciprocity terms. </p>
<p>Members agreed that this subject should be discussed in the context of the
  JCP.next proposals, but John Rizzo pressed for an early resolution. He argued
  that Aplix was responding to Oracle's unwillingness to license TCKs separately
  from commercial products. Don Deutsch asked whether Aplix was open to suggested
  changes in their proposed license. Mike DeNicola argued that if Oracle believes
  this license is bad for the community then he wanted to know what other licenses
  they might disapprove of. </p>
<p>Members reviewed the MIDP &quot;letter of agreement&quot; (on which this license was
  based) and Sun's comments on that license when they declined to approve it.
  No agreement was reached (other than to discuss this problem in the context
  of JCP.next) but Oracle representatives agreed to take the matter up with Oracle's
  legal organization.</p>
<h3>Java ME update</h3>
<p> Calinel Pasteanu provided a brief verbal update (no presentation) on Java
ME. He reported that Oracle had gathered feedback on the <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2010-10-0506/JavaME-Bonn-6-Oct-2010.pdf">Java
ME proposals</a> presented
  at the recent Bonn meeting. They circulated draft JSRs to 18 companies (including
non-EC members) and had received feedback from many. He reported that they are
working on revising licensing terms. They want to make sure they don't invalidate
previous releases of the ME platform, and agreed that MIDP3 and MSA must guarantee
continuity. He said that Oracle planned to file JSRs soon.</p>
<p>Sean Sheedy asked whether the feedback would be published and whether there
  would be public discussion. Roger Riggs promised that there would be a public
  discussion forum. Sean asked whether the JSR review period would be two or
  four weeks. Roger responded that he thought two would be sufficient.</p>
<p>Calinel noted that the Phase 1 proposals were just a start, and that Oracle
  wants to move forward on the Phase 2 porposals in parallel. He said that they
  haven't received much feedback on the Phase 2 proposals, and suggested that
  it might be useful to revive the ME Working Group to discuss these proposals. </p>
<h3>JCP.org update</h3>
<p>The EC went into private session for a brief update on jcp.org. Patrick reported
  that the PMO is actively researching collaboration-software platforms to provide
  Spec Leads and Expert Groups with the tools they need to carry out their work. </p>
<h3>Java SE process and schedule update</h3>
<p> Mark Reinhold provided an update on the <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2011-01-1112/java-se-7-8-update.pdf"> process
and schedule for Java SE</a>. Mike Milinkovich asked what could be done to ensure
that the next version of Eclipse, which ships in June, fully supports Java SE7
features. Mark responded that they are working with Eclipse.</p>
<p>Mark suggested that the work to modularize the platform should be done in
  the Java SE8 JSR. Josh asked whether a separate Expert Group might be needed.
  Mark suggested waiting to see how things go, and noted that those interested
  in Java ME could join the SE8 Expert Group.  </p>
<h3>Project Coin - JSR 334</h3>
<p>Joe Darcy provided an update on <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2011-01-1112/Jsr334-JcpEC.pdf">JSR 334: Project
Coin</a>. During the discussion Josh Bloch suggested that precompiled bundles
be made available for testing. Joe agreed to do so. </p>
<p>Joe noted that although he wasn't planning to do a demo, NetBeans has support
  for the new language features today. Mike Melinkovich asked about Eclipse support.
  Joe responded that IBM's representative on the Expert Group is an Eclipse Committer. </p>
<p>During the portion of the presentation that discussed the effort involved
  in making language changes Patrick pointed out that in addition to the work
  carried out by the development and QA teams four separate Compiler TCKs also
  need to be updated. </p>
<h3>Project Lambda - JSR 335</h3>
<p> Alex Buckley provided an update on <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2011-01-1112/2011-01_JCP_EC_ProjectLambda.pdf">JSR
335: Project Lambda.</a> A lengthy discussion followed, focusing on the use of
the term &quot;lambda expression.&quot; Sean Sheedy noted that Java is a  &quot;working
man's language&quot; and since
  this feature already presented a steep learning curve there was no need to
increase that by using a name that for many obfuscates the purpose of the feature.
He argued instead for the more programmer-friendly term &quot;functions.&quot; Others
expressed sympathy with this position. </p>
<p>Alex
  responded that whatever term was used would meet with some public disapproval.
  Josh Bloch asked whether the Expert Group had yet been formed, saying that
  he had applied for membership but hadn't yet been accepted. Jason Gartner noted
  that there is s a year's worth of discussion on the OpenJDK mailing list. Josh
  suggested that the OpenJDK project should be treated simply as a starting point
  for the Expert Group's work. </p>
<h3>Trusted Computing API for Java -
    JSR 321</h3>
<p> Werner Keil started Wednesday's meeting with a presentation on <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2011-01-1112/JSR321_PublicReview.pdf"> JSR
    321: Trusted
    Computing API for Java</a>. Since there will likely be a C++ as well as a
    Java implementation of this JSR Patrick noted that the JCP.next topic of    <em>Hybrid
    JSRs</em> might be of interest. Patrick asked about the schedule for the
    completion of this JSR. Werner responded that they hoped to complete later
    this year. </p>
<h3>2011 meeting schedule </h3>
<p>Members discussed the 2011 meeting schedule. Patrick noted that time-zone
  differences make it difficult for Korean members to participate in EC meetings.
  Members noted that teleconferences alternate between 7:00 am on
  the US West Coast and 7:00 am in Korea precisely in order to accommodate the
  Korean members. Calinel suggested that we should try to re-engage with the
  Korean members and he and Patrick agreed to talk to them about hosting a meeting
  in Seoul. We agreed to try to reach a decision within two weeks.</p>
<h3>Update on inactive JSRs</h3>
<p>Heather Vancura provided an update on inactive JSRs. Patrick noted that the
  JSR 306 Working Group had drafted language intended to deal with this situation
  (requiring a <em>Continuation Ballot</em> for JSRs that failed to make progress
  within a specified time.) Mike Milinkovich suggested that we should use the <em>Unresponsive
  Spec Lead</em> language in the existing Process Document to address this problem.
  After some discussion members agreed that we should start with JSRs that have
  not progressed beyond Expert Group Formation. The PMO was instructed to contact
  the Spec Leads and Expert Group members of these JSRs, and to ask them to either
  provide a plan for moving forward, or to withdraw the JSR. If they do not provide
  a suitable response the EC would then ask the PMO to publish notices on jcp.org
  stating that the JSRs are dormant, and seeking alternative spec leads. </p>
<p>We also agreed that all EC representatives of companies that had inactive
  JSRs would report back on them at the next EC meeting. </p>
<h3>Other Business </h3>
<p>John Rizzo pointed out that the problems caused by the frequent lack of a
  quorum on the ME EC and asked what could be done about it. Patrick reported
  that it would be difficult to do anything without a Process Document change.
  He noted that this problem is on the list for discussion in JCP.next. Members
  suggested that Patrick remind all EC members of the need to attend EC meetings.
  He promised to do so. </p>
<h3>Adjourn</h3>
<p>Patrick thanked Heather Vancura for making the logistical arrangements and
  then the meeting adjourned. </p>
<h3>JCP.next Working Group </h3>
<p>During the afternoon a subset of the ECs met as the JCP.next Working Group.
  The results of this discussion were incorporated into a <em>Master List of
  Proposed Changes</em> that will be published soon.</p>
