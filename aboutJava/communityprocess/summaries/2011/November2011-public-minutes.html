<h2>Minutes</h2>
<h3>Election results </h3>
<p>  Patrick reported on the results of the recent election (see the <a href="PMO-topics-September-2011.pdf">PMO
Presentation</a>.)</p>
<h3>Welcome and introduction to new members </h3>
<p>Since two of the three new members were not present :( we postponed this item
  until a future meeting. </p>
<h3>EC stats</h3>
<p> Patrick reviewed the <a href="EC_Stats22November2011.pdf">EC
    stats</a> presentation, noting that there has been a considerable amount
    of activity since the last meeting. </p>
<h3>Membership renewal report </h3>
<p>Patrick <a href="JCPMembership2011.pdf">presented</a> a report from the PMO
  on its membership-renewal activities. He reported that corporate members have
  not been billed for at least two years, and that since the last billing activity
  many have lost interest, merged, or become unreachable. It is likely that when
  this year's renewal drive is complete the total number of paying corporate
  members will be 60-80 as opposed to the (theoretical) 200 members who are currently
  registered in the database. Once this activity is completed the PMO will perform
  a similar review of individual members. (Since individuals are not billed,
  it is likely that there are many more &quot;lapsed&quot; members in the database.) Individual
  members will be asked to reconfirm their contact information, their commitment
  to continued membership, and their employer's information once a year. </p>
<p>He reported that when these activities are completed the number of members
  we are able to claim will be significantly reduced, but we will know that all
  are current and active. He also noted that during the past several months there
  has been a consistent and significantly increased number of new members compared
  with the previous couple of years. </p>
<h3>PMO implementation of JSR 348 </h3>
<p>Patrick <a href="2_8-primer-22November2011.pdf">presented</a> a report from the PMO
  on its implementation of JSR 348. He reported that a considerable amount of
  work had been done to modify the website, the PMOs processes, and our documentation.
  He asked EC members to let the PMO know if they discovered anything else that
  needed to be changed. </p>
<h3>The EC Merge and JSR.next.3 </h3>
<p>Patrick reported that during discussions with Oracle's legal staff he had
  been informed that certain of the topics planned for discussion and implementation
  in the third JCP.next JSR could not be addressed because of their possible
  impact on ongoing litigation. He expressed the hope that since the number of
  items for discussion is large, it ought to be possible to move forward with
  this JSR starting in the new year beginning with items that can be discussed,
  and he promised to provide EC members with a list of these items as soon as
  possible.</p>
<p>Patrick then presented a <a href="EC-merge.pdf">summary of proposals</a> for
  merging the ECs, which will form the basis of the second JCP.next JSR.</p>
<p>Members first discussed the optimal size of the merged EC. Patrick suggested
  that it would be relatively easy to reduce to 25, and that this number would
  still permit broad representation. Mike DeNicola pointed out that logistically
  it is difficult to find facilities to host large face-to-face meetings, and
  that large groups tend to make it difficult for everyone to express their opinions.
  He agreed that 25 was a reasonable compromise. Bruno Souza suggested that 22
  would be a good number since a smaller group is easier to manage and facilitates
  broader discussion, while Ben Evans argued for 19. </p>
<p>We then proceeded to discuss how we would make the reduction. Although there
  was considerable support for <em>Option
    1</em>(making all of the changes in 2012) members agreed that we should not
    do this unless all of the members whose terms would not otherwise expire
    until 2013 agreed. Don Deutsch suggested that Patrick email these members
    to ask whether they would be willing to voluntarily relinquish their seats
    in 2012. He agreed to do so. Gil Tene expressed a preference for making all
    of the changes at once, since otherwise this might make things more difficult
    for new members like Azul. Bruno Souza suggested that all elected members
    be permitted to serve their full terms. Mike DeNicola suggested
    that if the 2013 cohort did not agree to relinquish their seats in 2012 then
    a variation on <em>Option 1 </em>would be to make all the cuts in 2013. Steve
    Winkler suggested that one good reason for a gradual phase-in of the change
    is that the EC members would be able to focus on determining the best organizational
    structure without concern for their personal situations, removing the temptation
    to choose a less than ideal structure that would benefit themselves at the
    potential cost of the community.</p>
<p>John Rizzo argued that Oracle should commit to selecting
ratified candidates on merit rather than out of business interests. Mike DeNicola
  suggested that those whose attendance at meetings was the poorest should be
  the first to lose their seats. Gile Tene  expressed a preference for
  gradual change, and argued  that there should be no automatic rule determining
  who loses their seat. Don Deutsch
  responded that it would not be in Oracle's interests to re-appoint non-participants
  since the goal was to have a smaller group with active participation. He agreed
  with Gil, and argued that voters should strongly consider attendance records
  and participation when voting in elections. Mike DeNicola pointed out that
  Oracle had just re-nominated SK Telecom, who have a poor attendance record.</p>
<p>Mike DeNicola noted that the eventual size of the EC and the strategy
  chosen to make the reductions were not necessarily independent. Scott Jameson
  reminded members that it was Oracle's choice which of the ratified members
  would lose their seats. </p>
<p>It was pointed out that since ME members tend to participate less than others,
  using participation as a factor in deciding which seats to eliminate might
  further reduce the influence and participation of those who have an interest
  in Java ME. Anil Kumar pointed out that the smaller the size of the merged
  EC the more difficult it might be to pass ME-specific JSRs. Patrick responded
  that there are no plans to change the JSR voting rules, so that only a simple
  majority, and at least five <em>yes</em> votes, would be required.  </p>
<p>Since it was clear that we had not reached consensus we agreed to convert
  the previously-scheduled EC meeting on December 6 into a JCP.next Working Group
meeting, and to continue the discussion there. </p>
<h3>Meeting schedule for 2012 </h3>
<p>Patrick led a brief discussion on the proposed meeting schedule for 2012 (see
the <a href="PMO-topics-September-2011.pdf">PMO Presentation</a>.) No firm decisions
were made, but two of the suggestions raised in New Jersey were briefly discussed
without significant support. It was pointed out that holding public teleconferences
during f2f meetings would be a disadvantage to those on the phone; at such meetings
everyone should attend by phone. In response to the suggestion to hold a f2f
meeting immediately after the elections Werner Keil noted that November is a
busy conference season, and that January is probably the earliest practical time
to hold a f2f after the elections. </p>
<p>We agreed to continue the discussion via email. </p>
