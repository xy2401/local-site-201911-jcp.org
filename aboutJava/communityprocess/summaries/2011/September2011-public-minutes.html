<h2>Minutes</h2>
<h3>Personnel changes</h3>
<p>  Patrick reported personnel changes (see the <a href="PMO-topics-September-2011.pdf">PMO
    presentation</a>.)</p>
<h3>EC stats</h3>
<p> Patrick reviewed the <a href="EC_Stats13September2011.pdf">EC
    stats</a> presentation. </p>
<h3>PMO implementation of JSR 348 </h3>
<p>Harold Ogle <a href="Implementing2_8.pdf">presented</a> the PMOs plans
  for implementing JSR 348. It was suggested that the EC stats provided at each
  meeting be supplemented with information specifying which EC members currently
  have voting rights and that this information also be provided on the public
  EC membership page. EC members confirmed that public EC meetings would not
  be confined to JCP members. </p>
<h3>JavaOne update </h3>
<p>Heather VanCura provided an update on the PMO's plans for JavaOne  (see the <a href="PMO-topics-September-2011.pdf">PMO
presentation</a> for details.)</p>
<h3>Java ME platform update</h3>
<p>Roger Riggs gave a <a href="PlatformEvolution_v06_JCP_v05c.pdf">presentation </a>outlining
  Oracle's plans for the Java ME platform. He noted that Oracle and Aplix were
  working to resolve MIDP licensing-fragmentation issues. Sean Sheedy asked what
  the focus of these chages was. Roger responded &quot;feature phones.&quot; Jon Courtney
  noted that there was no mention of CDC. Roger stated that he had no update
  on that topic. Jon Courtney asked whether there were plans for synchronizing
  CDC and CLDC. Roger responded that a modular Java SE could replace CDC. Jon
  noted that even a modular Java SE might be too large for some CLDC applications.
  Calinel reiterated that the focus was on CDC: the intent was to define and
  update the base components, the VM and the language, and then to work on a
  stack of JSRs built on top of this. He noted that set-top box standards are
  set outside of the JCP and that additional effort would be needed to define
  a stack for that environment (neither CDC nor a modular Java SE would be suitable.)
  Jon responded that a new &quot;base&quot; should be created for the TV space. Calinel
  asked for requirements. Jon responded that he had provided his input at the
  Seoul meeting.</p>
<p><span class="style2">Edin Bektesevic</span> asked for an explanation of ESA
  (referenced on slide 4.) Roger explained that this would attempt to support
  the carrier business and their utilities &quot;end to end.&quot; He also noted that there
  are many embedded devices in vertical markets such as healthcare.</p>
<p>Sean Sheedy asked whether there were any plans to modularize MIDP. Roger responded
  &quot;maybe.&quot; Sean stated that when the two ECs are merged it would be &quot;game over&quot;
  for  Java ME.</p>
<p>John Rizzo cautioned against trying to solve all problems. Do not over-reach. </p>
<p>John Weir asked how they planned to handle credentials and security - these
  are complex issues. Ben Evans agreed, noting that there are many existing models
  to choose from, and noted that the granularity of permissions must be considered.
  Roger responded that they can take advantage of the SIM-card for security.
  Calinel reminded EC members that JSR 177 deals with security.</p>
<p>Rob Glidden asked how this would affect the TV business and the GINGA specifications.
  Roger responded that he didn't have enough insight into the business relationships
  to be able to say who from that market was on-board. </p>
<p><span class="style2">Magnus L&ouml;nnroth</span> suggested that a single base
  would be beneficial - the number of &quot;platforms&quot; or &quot;stacks&quot; should be reduced.
  Roger responded that it is very difficult to create a single base that can
  handle the very low-end devices and that they were doing their best to simplify
  things. Ben pointed out that lambda expressions will require considerable overhead.
  Roger agreed, and also noted that &quot;invoke dynamic&quot; will probably also be excluded.</p>
<p>Mark Rogalski asked whether this work would be licensed differently from the
  way Java ME is currently licensed. Roger responded that he didn't expect significant
  changes, and that all license terms would be disclosed as required. Mark asked
  whether people would be required to migrate to these new versions of Java ME.
  Roger said he didn't think so, but pointed out that he is not responsible for
  making business decisions.</p>
<p>John Rizzo argued that CLDC 1.1.1 must continue to be offered. </p>
<h3>Java SE platform update</h3>
<p>Mark Reinhold made a <a href="java-se-update-2011-09-13.pdf">presentation</a> outlining
  Oracle's plans for the Java SE platform. In response to a question about the
  syntax for lambda expressions he responded that it would be similar to C# and
  Scala. Werner Keil noted that the use of the term &quot;native&quot; in discussions of
  the module system could potentially be confused with JNI. Victor Grazi asked
  about the relationship between Project Jigsaw and OSGI. Mark responded that
  Jigsaw would not be an implementation of OSGI but that there would be a migration
  path from Jigsaw to OSGI, and that it must be possible to run an OSGI container
  on top of Jigsaw. Sean Sheedy asked for an explanation of the tensions between
  proponents of OSGI and the Java module system. Mark explained the necessity
  of making fundamental changes to the base platform in order to support all
  of the requirements - OSGI cannot do so. </p>
<h3>2012 face-to-face dates and locations</h3>
<p>EC members discussed locations and dates for face-to-face meetings in 2012.
  We agreed to meet in Sao Paulo, Brazil on May 16-17, prior to SouJava's annual <em>Just
  Java</em> conference. SouJava and TOTVS agreed to jointly host this meeting.
  There were several suggestions for the September f2f meeting: Prague (hosted
  by T-Mobile,) Stockholm (hosted by Ericsson,) and Ottowa (hosted by Oracle
  or IBM.) Patrick agreed to initiate a Doodle poll to allow members to specify
  their preference. </p>
<h3>Java EE platform update</h3>
<p>Linda DeMichiel gave a <a href="JavaEE7.pdf">presentation</a> outlining Oracle's
  plans for the Java EE platform. Patrick asked how they were tracking Java SE8.
  Linda responded that Java EE7 will be completed before SE8. Java EE8 would
  be built on SE8.</p>
<p><span class="style2">Magnus L&ouml;nnroth</span> stated that Ericsson plans
  to make much of its software deployable &quot;in the cloud&quot; and noted that they
  embed Oracle databases in each product. He asked whether licenses could be
  changed to permit this, otherwise they would want to be able to share databases.
  Linda responded that they intended to make it technically possible to share
  databases but noted that licensing is out of scope for this JSR. </p>
<h3>JSR 348 Expert Group meeting </h3>
<p>The EC then convened as the Expert Group for JSR 348. Members spent a considerable
  amount of time failing to reach consensus on the meaning of the term <em>consensus.</em> All
  issues raised  during this session were incorporated into the <a href="http://java.net/jira/browse/JSR348">Issue
  Tracker</a>. </p>
<h3>Improving end-user participation</h3>
<p>Ben Evans made a <a href="SE EC Increasing Involvement Talking Points.pdf">presentation</a> and
  led a discussion on how we could increase end-user participation in the JCP.
  Patrick Curran pointed out that the kind of soft-skills that are necessary
  for working in standards organizations can be very helpful in career-development. <span class="style2">Magnus
  L&ouml;nnroth</span> responded that they have no difficulty in identifying
  engineers who are interested in participating, but rather they need to be able
  to justify the work in order to obtain funding. They need to be able to demostrate
  the ROI. Victor Grazi pointed out that Credit Suisse supports engineers engaging
  in ToastMasters and Weight Watchers.</p>
<p>Magnus suggested that cross-functional teams involving testers and technical
  writers would be helpful. Ben agreed, adding that an &quot;evangelist&quot; role would
  also be a useful addition to an Expert Group. Roger Riggs asked how writers
  and testers could be persuaded to participate. Patrick argued that no persuasion
  would be necessary - they would be glad of the opportunity if their management
  permitted them to participate.</p>
<p>Roger suggested that two separate arguments were needed: one for executive
  management emphasizing the strategic value to the company of investing in standards
  and the second for immediate management emphasizing the technical benefits. </p>
<p>Josh Bloch noted that Google had lowered its participation in the JCP in response
  to the lawsuit between Oracle and Google.</p>
<p>Bruno Souza pointed out that participating in spec development is difficult.
  Some people want to participate but don't know how. SouJava is helping to educate
  them. They have a standards mailing list with 200 participants. He also noted
  that things are particularly difficult for those who lack skills in English.
  Patrick pointed out that if source-code is available even non-English speakers
  can participate (everyone speaks Java.) Roger Riggs suggested that translated
  specs or non-normative documentation would help. </p>
<h3>Goldman Sachs: Java in the enterprise</h3>
<p>Jon Weir gave a <a href="UpdateToJCP-EC-Sep2011.pdf">presentation</a> on Goldman
  Sach's use of Java. Patrick thanked him for the interesting end-user perspective.
  Magnus suggested that they should present some of this material at JavaOne. </p>
<h3>  Merging the ECs </h3>
<p>EC members discussed how the proposed EC merge might be implemented. After
  some discussion of whether targets should be set for the proportion of members
  who are primarily interested in each platform members agreed that non-binding
  targets would not be particularly helpful. The purpose of the ratification
  process is to ensure that an appropriate balance is achieved, and members stated
  their belief that Oracle should not use ratified seats as a reward for business
  partners. Patrick pointed out that it is sometimes difficult to find suitable
  candidates to nominate, and suggested that the EC submit their recommendations
  to Oracle early in the decision-making process. </p>
<p>It was  agreed that the number of members should be reduced from 32 to 25,
  with Oracle giving up one of its ratified seats and IBM holding only one rather
  than two seats. It was also agreed to keep the same ration of ratified to elected
  seats (two to one.)</p>
<p>It was suggested the cut in ratified seats be taken all at once (before the
  2012 election) but that members holding elected seats might be permitted to
  serve out their terms. </p>
<p>Members could not agree on whether to switch from a three-year election cycle
  to a two-year cycle.</p>
<p>During related discussions it was suggested that we might want to hold four
  rather than three face-to-face meetings each year and that it would be helpful
  of there was a well-defined algorithm for selecting the dates of f2f meetings.
  Members discussed whether attendance at f2f meetings should be mandatory without
  being able to resolve the problem this would cause due to the lack of resources
  in some member companies. Other suggestions were to hold our public teleconferences
  during the f2f meetings, and to hold a face to face meeting immediately after
  the annual elections in order to make it easier for new members to get up to
  speed. </p>
<h3>Adjourn</h3>
<p>Patrick thanked Goldman Sachs  for hosting, and the
  meeting adjourned. </p>
