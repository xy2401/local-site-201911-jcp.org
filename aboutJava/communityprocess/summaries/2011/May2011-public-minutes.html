<h2>Minutes</h2>
<h3>Java in Korea</h3>
<p>DH Kim presented an overview of <a href="/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2011-05-0304/JavaInKorea_May2011-Final.pdf">Java
in Korea</a>. </p>
<h3>Personnel changes</h3>
<p>  Patrick reported personnel changes (see the <a href="/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2011-05-0304/PMO-topics-May-2011.pdf">PMO
    presentation</a>.)</p>
<h3>Special election update</h3>
<p>Patrick reported that nominations for the Special Election had closed
  and that the election was in 
progress  (see the <a href="/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2011-05-0304/PMO-topics-May-2011.pdf">PMO presentation</a> for
details.)</p>
<h3>EC stats</h3>
<p> Patrick reviewed the <a href="/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2011-05-0304/EC_Stats3May2011.pdf">EC
    stats</a> presentation and noted that the four Java SE JSRs had been approved. </p>
<h3>JCP.next</h3>
<p>So that remote attendees would have an opportunity to participate,
  the JCP.next topic was addressed next. </p>
<p>Since the Working Group had been active during a period when the ECs were
  not fully staffed and before the Special Election, members noted the output
  of the Working Group was not set in stone. They expressed the hope that newly-elected
  members would support the approach taken so far, and that they would be able
and willing to contribute to our work later.</p>
<p>While discussing the proposal that the Standing Rules  include penalties for
  members who miss meetings it was suggested that face-to-face meetings be considered
  separately. Members noted that we would need to carefully consider the definition
  of  &quot;attending&quot; a f2f meeting. (For example, would it be  OK
  to attend - perhaps even partially - by phone?)</p>
<p>Members suggested that after the JSR was approved we should use the term &quot;Expert
  Group&quot; rather than &quot;Working Group.&quot;</p>
<p>Members made suggestions for minor modifications to the proposed wording of
  the JSR submission (these were later incorporated.)</p>
<p>We agreed to add a section addressing transparency of the election process. </p>
<p>While discussing the issue of ensuring that Terms of Use for collaboration
  software platforms are compatible with the JSPA members suggested that it would
  be simpler if we mandated the use of a single platform (java.net would be the
  obvious choice) rather than permitting Expert Groups to choose their own. During
  this discussion several members emphasized the importance of ensuring that
  we have guaranteed IP rights to all contributions made to JSRs.</p>
<p>It was suggested that the process for revising the Standing Rules include
  a requirement to provide a Change Log and/or a redline version of the document.  </p>
<p>Aguinaldo Boquimpani pointed out (for JSR2) that liaison with other standards
  organizations would be very desirable in the interactive TV space.</p>
<p>We agreed that the first meeting of the Expert Group (after JSR approval)
  should focus on the EG's mode of operation and on its transparency plan. </p>
<p>Members suggested that if we decide to operate through an <em>Ad-hoc Group</em> (a
  subset of the full EG,) this
  should be chaired by someone other than Oracle/the PMO. Mike DeNicola
  volunteered for this role. </p>
<h3>JavaOne 2011</h3>
<p>Patrick reported that JavaOne 2011 will be held in San Francisco from October
2-6 (see  the <a href="/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2011-05-0304/PMO-topics-May-2011.pdf">PMO presentation</a> for details.).
He reported on changes that Oracle was planning to make as a result of feedback
from last year's event. Members expressed their disappointment that the event
would again be held in three separate hotels, and unanimously passed the following
motion: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Resolved: the JCP Executive Committee requests that starting in 2012 JavaOne
    be located at a single, dedicated conference facility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Members expressed the hope that JCP sessions, despite being classified as
  BOFs, would be scheduled during the day rather than in the evening, and also
  that the sessions would not be scheduled so that they conflict with each other.
  They also requested that JCP events be scheduled for &quot;The Zone&quot; (one of the
  three hotels) rather than the Intercontinental Hotel (near Moscone) as was
  done in 2010. </p>
<p>Members discussed ways in which the EC could take advantage of JavaOne to
  meet and interact with JCP members. Suggestions included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A &quot;meet and mingle&quot; dinner.</li>
  <li>A two-hour meeting for which members could suggest agenda topics, and during
    which at least one of the chosen topics would be addressed by a JCP member
    rather than by someone from the EC.</li>
  <li>A &quot;meet the nominees&quot; session in preparation for the October election.</li>
  <li>Lightening talks on in-progress JSRs.  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Jcp.org and Java.net</h3>
<p>Patrick reported that the PMO is working with the java.net team to create a <em>JCP
  Community</em> on java.net. Each JSR would have its own Project, within which
  collaboration features such as Wikis, forums, email aliases, and issue trackers
  could be provided. He said he intended to create a project for JCP.next in order
  to prototype the process. (See the 
  <a href="/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2011-05-0304/PMO-topics-May-2011.pdf">PMO presentation</a> for details.)</p>
<h3>Device detection </h3>
<p>Stefano Andreani presented a proposal for a new JSR for <em>device detection
  and content adaptation</em>. Patrick thanked Stefano for presenting his proposal
  well in advance of its filing,
  and expressed the hope that others would similarly bring their proposals for
  discussion to the EC. </p>
<p>Members provided Stefano with feedback, suggesting, for
  example, that the term &quot;device detection&quot; was too broad. Aguinaldo
Boquimpani noted that a similar proposal was being worked
  in the Technical Group responsible for Question 4 of ITU-T's SG9. That proposal
  is 
  for a new Draft Recommendation by ITU-T called J.hadi (&quot;Home Area Device
Integration&quot;) led by NHK from Japan. It is completely<br />
based on Java and proposes a set of APIs to deal with device integration and
communication in a home area network and from 
these kind of networks to an external network. Aguinaldo pointed out that liaison
would be beneficial, but noted that he did not know how this could be achieved
within the JCP.</p>
<p>Werner Keil asked whether the ME EC should also vote on this JSR (it is targeted
  for Java EE.) Stefano responded that he did not plan to submit the JSR for
  an ME  vote, and pointed out that anyone could join
  the Expert Group.</p>
<p>Roger Riggs noted that the proposal would be very difficult to conformance-test,
  since it only defined interfaces. </p>
<p>Members agreed to continue the discussion, and to provide further feedback,
by email. </p>
<h3>Adjourn </h3>
<p>The meeting then adjourned for the first day. </p>
<h3>JCP.next (part 2)</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the second day the EC once again took up the topic of
  JCP.next. John Rizzo led a discussion on ways to transition to a merger of
  the ME and the SE/EE ECs. He suggested modifying the structure so that one
  EC would focus on Java EE and the other on Java SE and Java ME combined. Some
  members might hold two seats. Over time, the number of seats could be reduced
  through &quot;natural attrition&quot; and eventually the two ECs could be merged. </p>
<p>Members did not express much support for this plan, but it did stimulate a
  lively discussion and a consensus quickly emerged. Members agreed that <em>Java
  is one platform</em> and therefore there should be a single EC. The merger
  should take place around the time that Java SE8 completes, suggesting that
  the 2012 election would be a suitable goal. Don Deutsch suggested that we might
  need to add a &quot;hook&quot; into the first of the two JCP.next JSRs to facilitate
  a future merger (for example, to limit the terms of members elected in 2011.)
  We agreed to add a <em>Governance</em> section to JSR1 stating that we would
  &quot;explore ways to lay the groundwork for future changes.&quot;</p>
<h3>The other Java ME </h3>
<p>Jon Courtney led a discussion on the history and evolution of Java ME (see  <a href="/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2011-05-0304/TheOtherJavaME.pdf">The
    other Java ME</a>.) He expressed his concern that Java is losing (may already
    have lost) the User Interface in the mobile space to competing technologies.
    Discussing Java in set-top boxes, Roger Riggs asked what are the constraints
    (in footprint, etc.) of these platforms. (Knowing this would help in deciding
    how to update CDC and CLDC.) Jon responded that the typical set-top box is
    less powerful than most smartphones. He was not sure whether people be willing
    to  pay for a more powerful STB that ran more interesting applications. He
    noted that things move slowly in this market - there are many five-year-old
    devices still in use. Even if there was a major revision of theOCAP specification
    that doubled the footprint it wouldn't necessarily be widely adopted since
    cable operators want to get the most out of their already-deployed devices.</p>
<p>Mike Milinkovich suggested that cable operators will be challenged by streaming
  media. Jon responded that they will still be slow to respond. Roger Riggs asked
  Vincent Kwom whether the situation is salvageable. Vincent responded that there
  was no need to distinguish between CDC/CLDC and a &quot;TV stack.&quot; He
  argued that a common graphics library was needed. Jon responded that there
  were some specs
  &quot;ready to go&quot; in this area (eg, JSR 239.) Aguinaldo Boquimpani noted
  that there are similar issues with GINGA/J - they used LWUIT for their graphics
  library. Vincent reiterated that a new graphics library supporting animations
  is needed. Jon argued that HTML5 would inevitably win, and that the JCP should
  standardize a profile based on HTML5, specifying how it &quot;bridges&quot; to
  the Java core. He argued that a new API for graphics would be too little, too
  late. </p>
<p>Roger Riggs pointed to the <a href="http://www.wacapps.net/" onmousedown="return rwt(this,'','','','1','AFQjCNE3aHFCuGhqlU_a0AfQ30wwTiZO9g','','0CBkQFjAA')">Wholesale
  Applications Community</a> (WAC) as an example of the future of mobile graphics,
  and suggested that we should be looking into a similar Javascript-based model.
  He noted that JSR 290 bridges web-content and Java events, but pointed out
  that this is now a bit dated. He also noted that LWUIT is evolving with HTML.
  He agreed that a Javascript-Java bridge is very important. John Rizzo pointed
  out that BONDI (now part of WAC) was such a bridge.</p>
<p>Mike Milinkovich argued that embedded Java does not have much of a future
  - the next generation of devices will be browser-based. He lamented that fact
  that Oracle is providing no vision for Java in the UI space. Roger Riggs argued
  that JavaFX 2.0 represented such a vision. Mike responded that this is not
  a standard.</p>
<h3>Java applications for Digital TV</h3>
<p>Aguinaldo Boquimpani made an extensive presentation on Java standards for
  Digital TV in Brazil and elsewhere. (See <a href="/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2011-05-0304/JavaAppsForDTV-V1.1_Part1.pdf">part1</a> and <a href="/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2011-05-0304/JavaAppsForDTV-V1.1_Part2.pdf">part2</a> of
  his presentation.) Patrick Curran commented that this was the first time he'd
  seen a real opportunity for monetizing Java in the consumer world. Members
  were impressed by what was presented, but wondered what it would take to encourage
  similar changes elsewhere. Some members suggested that Brazil might be unique
  (in the need to use TV rather than broadband) to connect, but it was pointed
  out that Europe has strong TV standards, and a similar system might therefore
  be an easier sell there.</p>
<h3>Further discussion on JCP.next </h3>
<p>Sean Sheedy gave an impromptu presentation on some suggestions for improving
  the election process (addressing our quorum issues) and improving the quality
  of candidates.<br />
  <br />
These suggestions included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Increasing the technical content of EC meetings.</li>
  <li>Giving EC members a one-time &quot;sabbatical&quot; should a temporary
    condition prevent them from attending meetings.</li>
  <li>Offering vacated seats as non-voting       &quot;community&quot; seats
    until the next election cycle.</li>
  <li>Making election terms on year renewable for up to three years.</li>
</ul>
During the brief discussion that followed it became clear that there are different
perspectives on the role of the EC. Sean clearly believes that it should have
a strong technical component, while others argued that it is primarily concerned
with governance. <br />
<br />
Due to lack of time we agreed to continue these discussions in the JCP.next Working
Group.
<h3>Inactive JSRs </h3>
<p>Due to shortage of time, the <a href="/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2011-05-0304/InactiveJSRsUpdateMay2011.pdf">Inactive
    JSRs</a> presentation
  was not discussed, but simply read into the record. </p>
<h3>Adjourn</h3>
<p>Patrick thanked Dave Kim and SK Telecom for hosting, and the meeting adjourned. </p>
