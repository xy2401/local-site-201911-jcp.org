<H2>Minutes</H2>
<H3>Minutes of previous meetings</H3>
<P>The ECs discussed the public minutes from the previous December meeting. Don 
Deutsch pointed out that the ME EC was not (at the time of the discussion) 
quorate and that it would therefore be inappropriate to approve the minutes. 
After some discussion, EC members agreed that in future minutes should be 
reviewed, corrected (if necessary), and approved by mail rather than in EC 
meetings, in order to avoid this problem. </P>
<P>Later in the day, when the ME EC became quorate, the minutes were discussed 
again and were approved.</P>
<H3><STRONG>EC statistics</STRONG></H3>
<P>Patrick delivered the <A 
href="/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2010-01-1213/EC_Stats12January2010.pdf">EC 
stats presentation</A>. </P>
<H3>Personnel changes</H3>
<P>Patrick reported that Pardeep Khowash is the new alternate representative for 
AT&amp;T.</P>
<H3>Special election for Java ME</H3>
<H3>Year-end statistics</H3>
<P>Patrick presented year-end statistics, discussing the number of JCP members 
and the election results, and providing details of active JSRs, Spec Leadership, 
and Expert Group membership. See the <A 
href="/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2010-01-1213/2009JCPYearEndSummary.pdf">presentation</A> 
for details. </P>
<P>During discussion, it was noted that the number of active JSRs was down 
slightly, but not significantly, from the previous year. It was suggested that 
data on "un-deployed JSRs" (JSRs that have been completed, but which are not 
implemented commercially) would be interesting. Also, members suggested that we 
investigate the "slow JSRs" further, and provide an average of the completion 
times. Heather reported that the PMO is in the process of reviewing 
recently-completed JSRs, and that the investigaions would focus particularly on 
cases where the JSR took an unusually long (or short) time to complete. </P>
<P>Patrick provided some additional <A 
href="/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2010-01-1213/JCP-history.pdf">historical 
data</A> showing the rate of submission and completion of JSRs over time. 
Members pointed out that a decline in the number of new JSR submissions should 
not necessarily be interpreted as a problem, since as the platforms mature it 
would be expected that fewer new JSRs would be filed. Additional data on the 
number of maintenance releases would help to clarify the situation (these could 
be expected to increase over time.) </P>
<H3>Inactive JSRs</H3>
<P>Heather Vancura summarized the current situation with Inactive JSRs (see <A 
href="/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2010-01-1213/InactiveJSRs2010.pdf">presentation</A>) 
and members discussed what steps should be taken to ensure that these JSRs are 
either withdrawn or revitalized. EC members noted that there are a significant 
number of JSRs that have made no progress - often for several years - since the 
Expert Group was formed (or claimed to be in the process of formation), and 
suggested that the PMO focus on these initially, encouraging the spec leads to 
withdraw them. </P>
<P>The PMO agreed to do so, and representative from EC member companies agreed 
to help with JSRs whose spec leads work at their companies. </P>
<P>The PMO promised to report on progress at future meetings. </P>
<H3>Agility: lessons from JSR 330</H3>
<P>Bob Lee from Google led a discussion on JSR 330, focusing on factors that 
helped the Expert Group complete this JSR in record time. He emplasized the 
importance of working in the open (with public mailing lists and issue-tracking) 
and of doing all the work by email, discouraging private conversations. He 
pointed out that the majority of the work had been completed before the JSR was 
filed, noting that it might have been more difficult to handle contentious 
issues within the JCP process. Josh Bloch agreed, arguing that it is best to 
resove contentious issues before filing a JSR. </P>
<P>Other "best practices" include focusing on a relatively constrained area, and 
recruiting a highly motivated, skilful, and diplomatic Spec Lead.</P>
<P>Recommendations to the PMO included encouraging more transparency, and 
providing public issue tracking. </P>
<P>Heather noted that the PMO is conducting case studies in agility, and 
promised to report back to the ECs. </P>
<H3>2010 meeting schedule and locations</H3>
<P>EC members tentativly confirmed the 2010 meeting schedule, agreeing that the 
East Coast face-to-face meeting be held at AT&amp;T's premises in Atlanta, 
Georgia, while the European meeting would be hosted by Deutsche Telekom/T-Mobile 
in Bonn. Members agreed to discuss by email the possibility of changing the May 
date to enable more members to participate. </P>
<H3>Spec-lead discussion</H3>
<P>Alex Buckley gave a presentation on <A 
href="/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2010-01-1213/2010-01-12_JCP_EC_294_Transparency.pdf">JSR 
294 and transparency</A>. During this presentation he suggested that some kind 
of incubator process, mandating a formal scoping exercise before JSRs are filed, 
would be helpful. He suggested that the process should mandate publicly readable 
and writeable observer lists. </P>
<P>He also pointed out the importance and difficulty of engaging with "casual 
observers" - those who comment on a JSR in blogs or elsewhere outside of the 
"normal" discussion forums. </P>
<P>Finally, EC members discussed the importance of having a "Contribution 
Agreement" to ensure that those who participate in a JSR in a more casual manner 
(that is, not as members of the JCP) formally assert that they have the rights 
to the IP that they contribute, and make a formal grant of that IP. See the <A 
href="/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2010-01-1213/JSR_294_Observer_license.html">JSR 294 Observer license</A> for 
details.</P>
<H3>Discussion of incubator processes</H3>
<P>Three EC members with experience of incubator processes in other 
standards-developing organizations provided an introduction to how these 
organizations implement such processes:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><A href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/procedures.html">W3C</A>: Don 
  Deutsch 
  <LI><A 
  href="/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2010-01-1213/Eclipse-Incubation.pdf">Eclipse 
  Foundation: </A>Mike Milinkovich 
  <LI><A href="http://incubator.apache.org/">Apache Foundation</A>: Geir 
  Magnusson </LI></UL>
<P>Don Deutsch explained the <A 
href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/procedures.html#Patent">Patent Policy</A> 
options that W3C incubator groups must choose from. Option one involves no 
licensing commitments by participants. Under option three all particpants agree 
to abide by the W3C Patent Policy for any work transitioned to the 
Recommendation Track. Option two effectively gives each participant the freedom 
to chose which of the other two options they will abide by.</P>
<P>Ten or eleven incubator groups have been formed and a small number had 
progressed to become formal Working Groups. The incubator groups are 
approximately evenly split between the first and the third patent option. Groups 
that were formed simply to gather data or to perform research typically chose 
option one, while groups that hoped to move on to develop formal specifications 
typically chose option three. (None chose option two.) Don noted that the W3C 
had underestimated how important IP issues like these would be. Patrick noted 
that these issues are similar to those the JCP has been grappling with around 
contribution agreements and Terms of Use for participation in discussion forums. 
</P>
<P>Calinel asked how successful the whole incubator process had been, and Don 
responded "not very." Danny asked why anyone would work through the W3C rather 
than simply creating their own public mailing list for discussion. Don pointed 
out that the W3C provided a ready world-wide audience. </P>
<P>Don noted that the primary reason for defining the incubator process was to 
permit W3C activities while limiting the expenditure of staff resources (formal 
Working Groups must be assigned resources). He pointed out that the JCP would 
not have this problem since it makes no commitment to assign staff resources to 
Expert Groups.</P>
<P>Mike Milinkovich then presented an overview of the Eclipse incubation process 
(see <A 
href="/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2010-01-1213/Eclipse-Incubation.pdf">slides</A>.) 
He said that the process was inspired by the Apache foundation, but differed 
from Apache somewhat, since for Eclipse the incubator is a <EM>state</EM> 
whereas for Apache it is a <EM>place</EM>. Every Eclipse project starts in the 
incubation state, and the development of a statement of scope is a significant 
aspect of the process. The incubation process is "training wheels" for an 
Eclipse project. Expectations are lower than for fully-mature projects, and this 
is an opportunity for project members to learn the process and to make mistakes. 
The requirement to find two "mentors" from among the Architecture Council (which 
has 40-50 members in all) helps to filter out impractical projects. There are 
few IP issues since all Eclipse projects use the same license and adopt the same 
IP policy. </P>
<P>The process of "graduation" from incubator state typically involves a formal 
review. Releases are now labeled 1.x, and APIs are considered permanent. 
Projects are now expected to have mature and development, build, and release 
processes. While 10-15% of projects never progress beyond the incubation state 
the majority do graduate, some in only a few months while others take longer. 
</P>
<P>Patrick pointed out that if the JCP had a similar incubation state this would 
resolve the problems with JSRs that never progress beyond the Expert Group 
formation stage.</P>
<P>Finally, Geir Magnusson provided an overview of the <A 
href="http://incubator.apache.org/">Apache incubator process</A>. This was 
created to ensure that code donations to Apache were legaly appropriate, and to 
ensure that projects follow Apache processes and principles. He noted that there 
are many similarities to Eclipse incubators, but that at Eclipse the process is 
more top-down (with the Board having significant influence) whereas Apache is 
more bottom-up (the project has significant autonomy.) As with Eclipse, the 
primary purpose is to ensure that the project is ready to take off, and as with 
both Eclipse and W3C, patent grants are covered by the incubator process. </P>
<P>Members then discussed the implications of an incubator process for the JCP. 
It was pointed out that the JCP's lack of a standard licensing model might pose 
difficulties since uncertainty about the eventual licensing model might deter 
people from participating in an incubator project. <BR><BR>John Rizzo asked 
whether incubation was just another stage at the beginning of the process. Mike 
DeNicola pointed out that mentoring was an essential component of the Eclipse 
and Apache incubation processes. Steve Wolfe noted that many Spec Leads expect 
to make commercial gains from their activity. It was therefore suggested that 
incubator processes might apply only to Open Source projects. <BR><BR>Danny 
Coward pointed out that an incubator process might increase the chances of an 
Expert Group succeeding, and would eliminate the "surprise factor" as EC members 
have only a two-week period to decide whether to support new JSRs.<BR><BR>Wayne 
Carr noted the "Gold Rush problem," whereby those&nbsp; who stake a claim to 
"territory" by filing a JSR are then considered to own that 
territory.<BR><BR>John Rizzo argued that if an incubator process is introduced 
it should not require an additional vote.<BR><BR>Josh Bloch asked whether we 
should allow multiple incubator projects in the same space. Geir Magnusson said 
yes - we want the best technology, not the first to be proposed.<BR><BR>Scott 
Stark argued that any discussion of incubators is premature, and that the larger 
JCP process issues should be resolved first. <BR><BR>[The EC adjourned for the 
day, but agreed to pick up the discussion the following morning. The notes below 
are from the next day's discussion.] <BR><BR>The follow-on discussion quickly 
moved on from incubators to a broader discussion of licensing issues. John Rizzo 
argued that a complete overhaul of processes and licensing models was needed. 
Ideally, a unified licensing model would be introduced. Josh Bloch argued for a 
permissive BSD-like license. Others argued that this would not ensure that 
people who make changes to a technology would give them back to the community, 
as the GPL requires. <BR><BR>Wayne Carr and others pointed out to new members 
that the EC has had extensive discussions about similar licensing suggestions in 
the past (with particularly important resolutions passed at the "meeting in the 
barn" in December 2007). They noted that much of the investigation being 
proposed had already been done and probably didn't need to be repeated. With the 
Oracle acquisition pending and expected to be determined one way or the other 
shortly, it was decided to postpone the discussion.<BR><BR>Tim Peierls suggested 
that the EC present Oracle with an explanation of the changes they would like to 
see in the organization. There was no consensus to do so, but after the meeting 
Wayne Carr circulated by email a summary of previous discussions. </P>
<H3>Review of the Sun/Apache situation</H3>The meeting went into private session 
to provide a review of the history of the Sun/Apache situation for the benefit 
of new members. 
<H3>JSR 275 Presentation </H3>
<P>Werner Keil gave a presentation on <A 
href="/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2010-01-1213/JSR-275_PR-EC-F2F.pdf">JSR 
275</A>. Members expressed a variety of concerns about the design approach taken 
by the Expert Group, including naming issues and a possible overlap with JSR 
310: Date and Time APIs. (JSR 275's Public Review Ballot was scheduled for the 
week after this EC meeting. In that ballot many EC members expressed their 
concerns by voting "no" and the ballot failed. See the <A 
href="/en/jsr/results.id=5055">results</A> for details.) </P>
<H3>MIDP3 presentation and demo</H3>
<P>Paul Su from Aplix gave a <A 
href="/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2010-01-1213/MIDP_3.0_technical_overview.pdf"></A>technical 
overview of MIDP 3, followed by a demonstration. See the <A 
href="/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2010-01-1213/MIDP_3.0_technical_overview.pdf">presentation</A> 
for details. </P>
<H3>ME Working Group status</H3>
<P>Sean Sheedy gave a brief <A 
href="/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2010-01-1213/Java_ME_WG_2010-01-12.pdf">status 
report</A> from the ME Working Group. It was decided that the next meeting would 
be in two weeks. </P>
<H3>Modularity and profiles</H3>
<P>Patrick introduced this discussion by pointing out that there are increasing 
calls for a merge of Java ME and SE, that modularity is being introduced in Java 
SE, and that profiles have been introduced in Java EE. What are the implications 
of these trends for the work of the JCP, and for the broader issues of 
compatibility? <BR><BR>Doug Lea pointed out that it is often difficult for 
technologies to "piggy back" on top of the core. Different rules are required 
for the base. Dependency management, and new testing strategies are required. 
Patrick responded that the Java EE CTS is being modularized into component 
TCKs.<BR><BR>Roberto said that Java EE is taking things slowly, and so far has 
introduced only one profile.<BR><BR>Alex Buckley noted that the JDK is 
being&nbsp; physically broken into smaller pieces, but unless a module system is 
actively invoked the user of the system will see no difference (the platform 
will still be "complete.")<BR><BR>Patrick argued that once modularization is 
enabled, subsetting is inevitable. Tim Peierls noted that the RESTlet community 
has a common code base but builds for multiple environments (Java SE, Java EE, 
Android, Google GWT, etc.)<BR><BR>Patrick asked whether modularity might result 
in fragmentation. John Rizzo argued that this is not inevitable. In the ME space 
the problem is not the existence of "modules" but rather incompatibilities in 
implementations - optionality is beneficial. Danny noted that we have 
significant "fragmentation" between Java SE and Java ME (ME is a subset of an 
early version of SE, and the two have since diverged.) The API, and language 
subset in Java ME should be consistent with Java SE. Wayne Carr pointed 
out&nbsp; that it is difficult to create optional specifications that run on 
both platforms. <BR><BR>Patrick argued that optionality endangers 
interoperability.<BR><BR>Alex Buckley pointed out that if so, this is a failure 
of dependency management. In a well-designed system requirements are documented 
and missing components would be downloaded (or could be manually installed.) 
Steve Wolfe asked whether JSR 294 implements such a dependency-management 
system. Alex responded no - it enables such a system, but the Expert Group did 
not want to "tread on the toes" of any individual module system. Steve asked 
about the dangers of incompatibilities between the behavior of modules as the 
interact with different environments. Alex responded that this can be handled by 
versioning on top of dependencies. Compatibility is well 
understood.<BR><BR>Wayne pointed out that modularization doesn't necessarily 
mean a free-for-all. Profiles will be defined. Josh argued that making the 
compatibility tests freely available would help.<BR><BR>Steve Wolfe asked who 
defines modules? John Rizzo responded that in Java ME individual JSRs define 
modules, and then there are "umbrella JSRs" that define stacks (profiles.) He 
noted that for Java ME the issue of royalties owed per JSR was an obstacle to 
the implementation of a real module/dependency-management system. Scott Stark 
pointed out that this is soluble. A factory method could be designed to fail if 
the appropriate license was not present. <BR><BR>Steve Wolfe asked who decides 
the level of granularity with which APIs are exposed and modules defined. Don 
Deutsch asked whether the platform-subset issue is confined to Java ME and Java 
SE. Danny responded "no", since Java EE depends on the entire Java SE platform. 
Roberto noted that Java EE might prefer a smaller base, and he noted that the 
influence is two-way, since Java EE specifies requirements for Java 
SE.<BR><BR>Doug, Patrick, and Scott argued that dependency management is a good 
thing, that TCKs must be aware of dependencies, and that specs should explicitly 
call out dependencies.</P>
<H3>Adjourn</H3>
<P>After thanking Sun and Heather Vancura of the PMO for hosting and arranging 
the meeting, the ECs adjourned. </P>
