 <font size="+2">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</font> 
<p>  </p>
 
<p> The international Java community develops and evolves Java&#8482; technology 
specifications using the Java Community Process (JCP). The JCP produces high-quality 
specifications in "Internet time" using an inclusive, consensus building approach
that produces a specification, a reference implementation (to prove the specification
can be implemented), and a technology compatibility kit (a suite of tests,
tools, and documentation that is used to test implementations for compliance
with the specification). </p>
   
<p> Experience has shown that the best way to produce a technology specification 
is to gather a group of industry experts who have a deep understanding of 
the technology in question and then have a strong technical lead work with 
that group to create a first draft. Consensus around the form and content 
of the draft is then built using an iterative review process that allows an
ever-widening audience to review and comment on the document. </p>
   
<p><strike> This version of the JCP was developed by Sun based on input from 
leading Java partners.</strike> <u>This version of the JCP was developed through
the JCP by means of JSR 99 and JSR 171, led by Sun and the combined Executive
Committees as the expert group.</u> </p>
 
<p><strike>In this version, an</strike> <u>An </u>Executive Committee (EC) 
representing a cross-section of both major stakeholders and other members 
of the Java community is responsible for approving the passage of specifications 
through key points of the JCP and for reconciling discrepancies between specifications 
and their associated test suites. There are two ECs: one to oversee the Java 
technologies for the desktop/server space (with responsibility for the J2SE&#8482; 
and J2EE&#8482; specifications) and the other to oversee the Java technologies for
the consumer/embedded space (with responsibility for the J2ME&#8482; specification).
 </p>
   
<p> There are four major steps in this version of the JCP: </p>
   
<ol>
  	<li><b>INITIATION</b>: A specification targeted at the desktop/server
or consumer/embedded space is initiated by community member(s) and approved 
for development by the responsible EC.<br>
     <br>
   	</li>
   <li><b>COMMUNITY DRAFT</b>: A group of experts is formed to develop a
first draft of the specification that both the community and the responsible
EC will then review. The expert group uses feedback from the review to revise 
and refine the draft. At the end of the review, the responsible EC decides 
if the draft should proceed to the next step.<br>
     <br>
   	</li>
   <li><b>PUBLIC DRAFT</b>: The draft goes out for review by the public where 
anyone with an Internet connection can read and comment on the draft. The 
expert group uses the public feedback to further revise the document. Finally, 
the leader of the expert group sees that the reference implementation and 
its associated technology compatibility kit are completed before sending the
specification to the responsible EC for final approval.<br>
     <br>
   	</li>
   <li><b>MAINTENANCE</b>: The completed specification, reference implementation, 
and technology compatibility kit are updated in response to ongoing requests 
for clarification, interpretation, enhancements, and revisions. The responsible 
EC can review all proposed changes to the specification and indicate which 
ones can be carried out immediately and which will require the specification 
to be revised by an expert group. Challenges to one or more tests in a specification's 
technology compatibility kit are ultimately decided by the responsible EC 
if they cannot be otherwise resolved. </li>

<p> </p>
   
<p> <b>Java Community Process (JCP)</b>: The formal process described in this
document for developing or revising Java technology specifications. </p>
   
<p> <b>Java Community Process Member (Member)</b>: A company, organization, 
or individual that has signed the JSPA and is abiding by its terms.  </p>
   
<p> <b>Java Specification Participation Agreement (JSPA)</b>: A one-year renewable
agreement between Sun Microsystems and a company, organization or individual
that allows the latter entities to participate in the Java Community Process.
</p>
   
<p> <b>Individual Expert Participation Agreement (IEPA)</b>: An agreement 
between Sun Microsystems and an individual that allows that individual to 
serve on an Expert Group at the invitation of the Specification Lead. There 
is no fee associated with the IEPA and it is valid until the Expert Group 
disbands. The IEPA allows individual technical experts who do not represent 
companies or organizations to participate on Expert Groups. </p>
   
<p> <b>Executive Committee (EC)</b>: The Members who guide the evolution of
the Java technologies. The EC represents a cross-section of both major stakeholders
and other Members of the Java Community. Members must have signed the EC
acceptance letter in order to serve on the EC. The EC Policies and Procedures
are in Appendix A. </p>
   
<p> <b>Program Management Office (PMO)</b>: The group within Sun Microsystems 
that is responsible for administering the JCP and chairing the EC. </p>
   
<p> <b>Java Specification (Specification)</b>: A written specification for 
some aspect of the Java technology. This includes the language, virtual machine, 
Platform Editions, Profiles, and application programming interfaces. </p>
   
<p> <b>Platform Edition Specification (Platform Edition)</b>: A Specification 
that defines a baseline API set that provides a foundation upon which applications, 
other APIs, and Profiles can be built. There are currently three Platform 
Edition Specifications: J2SE, J2EE, and J2ME. </p>
   
<p> <b>Profile Specification (Profile)</b>: A Specification that references 
one of the Platform Edition Specifications and zero or more other JCP Specifications 
(that are not already a part of a Platform Edition Specification). APIs from 
the referenced Platform Edition must be included according to the referencing 
rules set out in that Platform Edition Specification. Other referenced specifications 
must be referenced in their entirety. </p>
   
<p> <b>Reference Implementation (RI)</b>: The prototype or "proof of concept" 
implementation of a Specification. </p>
   
<p> <b>Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK)</b>: The suite of tests, tools, 
and documentation that allows an implementor of a Specification to determine 
if their implementation is compliant with that Specification. </p>
   
<p> <b>JCP Web Site</b>: The web site where anyone with an Internet connection 
can stay informed about JCP activities, download draft and final Specifications, 
and follow the progress of Specifications through the JCP. </p>
   
<p> <b>JCP Specification Page (Spec Page)</b>: Each Specification approved 
for development or revision will have a dedicated public web page established 
on the JCP Web Site to contain a history of the passage of the Specification 
through the JCP, including a record of the decisions, actions, and votes taken
by the EC with respect to the draft Specification. </p>

<h3>1.1 INITIATE A JAVA SPECIFICATION REQUEST</h3>
 </a>
   
<blockquote>   
  <p> <b>definition - Java Specification Request (JSR)</b>: The document submitted
to the PMO by one or more Members to propose the development of a new Specification
or significant revision to an existing Specification.    </p>
     
  <p> <b>definition - Umbrella Java Specification Request (UJSR)</b>: A JSR 
that defines or revises a Platform Edition or Profile Specification. A UJSR 
proceeds through the JCP like any other JSR. </p>
     
  <p> <b>definition - Expert</b>: A Member representative (or an individual 
who has signed the IEPA) who has expert knowledge and is an active practitioner 
in the technology covered by the JSR. </p>
     
  <p> <b>definition - Expert Group</b>: The group of Experts who develop or
make significant revisions to a Specification. </p>
     
  <p> <b>definition - Specification Lead (Spec Lead)</b>: The Expert responsible 
for leading the effort to develop or make significant revisions to a Specification 
and for completing the associated Reference Implementation and Technology 
Compatibility Kit. A Spec Lead (or their host company or organization) must 
be a Java Community Process Member. </p>
  </blockquote>
     
  <p> One or more Members can initiate a request to develop a new Specification, 
or carry out a significant revision to an existing one, by sending a JSR to
the PMO. The JSR <strike>should follow</strike> <u>must use</u> the template 
available at the JCP Web Site. The JSR serves to identify the Members making 
the request (the sponsors), a Specification Lead, and the initial members 
of the Expert Group. It will also describe the proposed Specification, the 
reason(s) for developing or revising it, the primary target Java Platform 
Edition, an estimated development schedule, and any preexisting documents, 
technology descriptions, or implementations that might be used as a starting 
point. Any JSR under consideration can be withdrawn by its sponsors without 
explanation at any time prior to the completion of the JSR approval vote (see
section 1.3) upon request by the initiator(s) to the PMO. </p>
   <a name="1.1.1">   
  <h4>1.1.1 REVISE EXISTING SPECIFICATIONS</h4>
   </a>
     
  <p> Existing Specifications, along with their associated RIs and TCKs, are
maintained by a designated Maintenance Lead using the processes described 
in section 4 of this document. Maintenance Leads (and their host company or
organization) are expected to assume long term ownership of their Specification, 
RI, and TCK with due respect of the will of the Java Community Members with 
regard to evolution. This means that a Maintenance Lead will automatically 
be the Spec Lead for all significant revisions to their Specification going 
forward but he or she will not have the exclusive right to decide when a significant
revision will take place. That will be decided by the EC in response to a
revision JSR that can be initiated by any Java Community Member (or Members).
The only provision is that the initiator(s) should make a reasonable effort
to get some of the members of the previous Expert Group to join the revision
effort. </p>
   <a name="1.1.2">   
  <h4>1.1.2 PROTECT THE INSTALLED BASE AND GUARD AGAINST FRAGMENTATION</h4>
   </a>
     
  <p> Changes to the Java programming language, the Java virtual machine (JVM),
the Java Native Interface (JNI), packages in the "java.*" space, or other
packages delivered as part of J2SE, have the potential to seriously disrupt
the installed base if carried out inconsistently across the Platform Editions.
In order to protect the installed base, any such changes can only be accepted
and carried out within a UJSR for J2SE. </p>
     
  <p> In order to guard against fragmentation, new Platform Edition Specifications 
will not substantially duplicate existing Platform Editions or Profiles.

   <a name="1.1.3">   
  <h4>1.1.3 PROFILES AND API SPECIFICATIONS TARGET CURRENT PLATFORM EDITIONS</h4>
   </a>
     
  <p> All new or revised Specifications must be compatible with the most recent
versions of the targeted Platform Edition Specifications. In order to achieve
this, all UJSRs to define new Profile Specifications, or revise existing
Profile Specifications, must reference the latest version of the Platform
Edition Specification they are based upon. </p>

  <h4>1.1.4 J2ME PROFILES AND J2ME BUILDING BLOCKS </h4>
   </a>
     
  <blockquote><b>definition - J2ME Building Block (Building Block)</b>: A 
subset of one or more APIs defined in the J2SE or J2EE Platform Edition Specifications. 
The J2ME Platform Edition Specification is a collection of Building Blocks. 
J2ME Profile Specifications can build up desired functionality by combining 
new API sets with existing Building Blocks. </blockquote>
       
    <p> J2ME Profiles will normally be based upon the existing Java virtual 
machine and language Specifications. When such profiles also need to include 
subsets of J2SE and/or J2EE functionality, they will reference J2ME Building 
Blocks. </p>
       
    <p> Building Blocks are created and revised within the UJSR for the J2ME 
Platform Specification. It is likely that different J2ME Profiles will require 
different J2SE/J2EE subsets. For example, different categories of devices 
may need different subsets of the "java.net" package. In order to accommodate 
this, no fundamental restrictions are placed upon the number of times or ways
in which J2SE/J2EE functionality can be packaged into J2ME Building Blocks.
    </p>
       
    <p> Building Blocks can be proposed in a UJSR for the J2ME Specification. 
However, it is recognized that the consumer and device marketplaces can change 
very rapidly in comparison to the desktop and server marketplaces. The definition 
of new Building Blocks (as well as the revision of existing blocks) may need 
to be carried out very quickly in order for some J2ME Profiles to keep up 
with changing market needs. In the interest of speed, J2ME Building Blocks 
may also be defined and revised within the JCP Maintenance Cycle (see section 
4.2) for the J2ME Specification.  </p>
       
    <p> Expert Groups that need to quickly create or update a J2ME Building 
Block should approach the Maintenance Lead for the J2ME Platform Edition Specification
with their requests. The J2ME Maintenance Lead, after consultation with both
the J2ME Expert Group and the Maintenance Lead(s) of the Platform Edition(s)
the block is to be derived from, may propose the new Building Block as part
of a maintenance update to the J2ME specification. Note that the EC can require
any Building Block proposed as part of the Maintenance Cycle to be defined
in a major revision to the J2ME Specification (see section 4.2.2). </p>
       
    <p> If the Maintenance Lead declines a Building Block request, the requesting 
Expert Group has the options of initiating a UJSR for J2ME (which may be time
consuming) or creating the needed APIs in any namespace not reserved for
use by existing Platform Edition Specifications.  </p>
       
    <p> In exceptional circumstances, the J2ME Specification may define J2ME 
Building Blocks for use with special classes of devices that can only implement 
subsets of the Java virtual machine or language Specifications. Such Building 
Blocks can be defined and approved only within a UJSR for J2ME. They cannot 
be defined using the Maintenance Cycle because proposals for Building Blocks 
for these special classes of devices must be subject to the widest possible 
review.</p>
     
    <p><u><b>1.1.5 CONTINUED AVAILABILITY</b></u></p>
    <p><u> The technology that a JSR defines can be delivered as part of
a profile or platform edition, it can be delivered stand-alone or both. Future
versions of the technology may be integrated into a profile or a platform
edition while previous versions were not. The submitter of a JSR will be
required, via the JSR submission form, to indicate if it is the submitter's
goal to deliver the JSR's RI and TCK as part of a profile or platform edition,
stand-alone or both. When delivering the JSR's RI and TCK integrated into
a profile or platform and not delivering these separately and where the RI
and TCK of previous versions were available separately, the submitter must
state the rationale. Also in this case the JSR Review (see section 1.2) will
be 4 weeks instead of 14 days.</u></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><u>A JSR for a new version of an API that proposes to become part
of a profile or platform edition and is considering discontinuing stand-alone
availability where the previous JSR for this API did not indicate this plan,
must make that proposal to discontinue stand-alone availability one version
ahead.</u>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><u><b>1.1.6 PLATFORM INCLUSION</b></u></p>
    <p><u>JSRs that want to be considered to be included in the definition
of a platform edition or a profile should describe this intent in the JSR's
submission. The final decision whether a specific JSR is included in a profile
or a platform edition is made by the Spec Lead and Expert Group of that platform
edition JSR or profile JSR, and confirmed by the EC ballots on those JSRs.
If the platform edition or profile JSR turns down the request for inclusion
then the JSR for the API will be required to deliver a stand-alone RI and
TCK.</u><br>

          <h3>2.1 FORM THE EXPERT GROUP</h3>
             
          <p> When a JSR is approved, the PMO will notify the identified Spec
Lead to form the Expert Group. If the Member contributing the Spec Lead withdraws
from the Community before the JSR is approved, the PMO will request the initial
Expert Group to choose a replacement from among themselves who is willing
to take on the duties defined in this document (including taking responsibility
for the RI and TCK, working towards the estimated schedule given in the JSR,
and assuming the position of Maintenance Lead as described in section 4).
          </p>
             
          <p> There is no size limit on the Expert Group. The Spec Lead may 
add additional Experts at any time provided the existing Expert Group is consulted
first. New members may be added, for example, to increase diversity of opinion.
A Spec Lead recruits new Experts by approaching other Members directly and
working with them to identify an expert and bring him or her into the Expert
Group. Individual experts can be brought into the Expert Group if they sign
an IEPA. </p>
   <a name="2.1.1">           
          <h4>2.1.1 FREEDOM OF WORKING STYLE</h4>
           </a>
             
          <p> Each Expert Group is free to define and follow whatever working 
style it finds most productive and appropriate as long as it is compatible 
with the JCP. Use of the Internet is encouraged. E-mail exchanges on mailing 
lists established for the use by the Expert Group, along with conference calls
and group meetings, have been used by past Expert Groups to discuss and resolve
issues raised as the draft evolves. In-person group meetings are useful but
they tend to slow down work considerably due to the need to coordinate schedules.

           </a>
             
          <p> An Expert may withdraw from the Expert Group at any time. When 
this happens, the Spec Lead may approach the Member who originally contributed 
the Expert and work with them to find a replacement. If no replacement is 
offered, the Spec Lead may recruit a replacement from another Member if desired. 
If the departing Expert is the Spec Lead, the Expert Group should choose one
of their members as the new Spec Lead provided he or she is willing to take
on all of the responsibilities defined in this document. </p>

          <h4>2.1.3 UNCOOPERATIVE OR UNRESPONSIVE EXPERT GROUP MEMBERS</h4>
           </a>
             
          <p> There may be rare instances when members of the Expert Group 
feel that one of their fellow Experts is not acting in ways that advance the
work of the Expert Group. These concerns should be brought to the attention 
of the Spec Lead and/or the EC as quickly as possible so they may be proactively 
addressed and resolved. The Expert Group is expected to make a reasonable 
effort to resolve any such issues among themselves. If a 2/3 majority of the
members of the Expert Group find that a Spec Lead is being unresponsive, and
the Spec Lead does not work to resolve the situation in a timely manner, the
EC may direct the PMO to ask the Member who provided the Spec Lead to provide
a replacement. </p>

          <h3>2.2 WRITE THE FIRST DRAFT OF THE SPECIFICATION</h3>
             
          <p> The Expert Group should begin work by considering the requirements 
set forth in the JSR, any contributed documents or technology descriptions, 
comments received during JSR Review and, if this is a revision of an existing 
Specification, the Change Log kept by the Maintenance Lead (see section 4). 
Additional input can be obtained from discussions with other Members, industry 
groups, software developers, end-users, and academics. The goal is to define 
requirements and then write a draft suitable for review by the Community.
           </p>
              
          <p> When the Expert Group decides that the first draft is ready 
for review, the Specification Lead will send the draft, along with any additional 
files required for review, to the PMO. The Specification Lead should also 
suggest the length of the Community Review period if the Expert Group feels 
it should go beyond the minimum 30 days. </p>

Reference Implementation (RI) and Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) and
its licensing under terms compatible with the licensing guidelines established 
for use within the JCP. The Spec Lead will provide the EC with the terms under

of the review period (the draft is frozen during the last 7 days of Community 
Review in order for the EC to complete their Draft Specification Approval 
Ballot). The PMO will notify Members of any updated drafts and change synopses 
received and make them available to them for download. </p>
               
            <p> During Community Review, EC members are strongly encouraged 
to have one or more technical members of their organization carry out a review 
of the draft in order to uncover possible overlap between the draft and other 
Specification(s) or duplication of features or services already provided by
other Specifications. EC members should inform the Expert Group of any such

out maintenance on the Specification and dealing with errata by fielding requests
for clarification, interpretation, and enhancements to the Specification from
both Members and the public via an e-mail address listed in the Specification. 
The ML will consider all requests and will decide how and if the Specification 
should be updated in response. The ML will typically be the Spec Lead from 
the Expert Group that developed the Specification. The ML is not required 
to do all these tasks by himself or herself. The ML may find it very helpful 
to recruit members of the Expert Group that helped to develop the Specification 
to assist with the Maintenance duties. </p>

company or organization) is expected to assume long term ownership of the 
Specification, RI, and TCK with due respect of the will of the Java Community

automatically be the Spec Lead for all significant revisions to their Specification 
going forward but he or she will not have the exclusive right to decide when 
a significant revision will take place (see section 1.1.1). </p>

the PMO will declare the Specification to be Dormant. No further maintenance

in this document, EC ballots are approved if (a) a majority of the votes cast
are "yes" votes, and (b) a minimum of 5 "yes" votes are cast. Ballots are
otherwise rejected. 	</li>
                                         <li>"No" votes must be accompanied

                                         <li>When a failed EC ballot results 
in the closing of a JSR, at least 1 month must pass before the JSR can be 
reinitiated. 	</li>

to the Java language, are approved if (a) at least a two-thirds majority of
the votes cast are "yes" votes, (b) a minimum of 5 "yes" votes are cast, and
(c) Sun casts one of the "yes" votes. Ballots are otherwise rejected.  	</li>
