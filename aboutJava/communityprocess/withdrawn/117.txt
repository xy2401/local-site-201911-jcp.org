This JSR never arrived at the community review stage, and our last expert 
group drafts received very little comments.
In fact, during this period, there has been very low participation and 
demand to complete this JSR.
Furthermore, during discussions about the time the last expert group drafts 
were released, we realized the fact that the delivery of the JSR goals is 
only possible if we have very close coordination with all the other J2EE 
constituent JSRs. This is a very significant discovery regarding the 
standardization complexities involved w/ this JSR.
Since there's no formal mechanisms put in place for such a coordination 
that suits the purposes of this particular JSR, and since many of the 
related JSRs have their own independent tracks and concerns, and given the 
originally defined scope of our JSR, which focused on the *application* 
rather than infrastructure issues involved in supporting highly-available 
J2EE apps, we agreed to withdraw this JSR.
Subsequently, we can all advocate that the work to meet the objectives of 
this JSR be hosted in those affected JSRs (e.g. Servlet, EJB, Connector, 
etc.) that constitute the standard JSR set for the J2EE platform.
In this way, useful incremental extensions could be put in place and 
adopted by the J2EE platform in a more practical manner. The resulting 
coordination issues will be left for resolution according to the overall 
J2EE JSR coordination model that is already in place.
