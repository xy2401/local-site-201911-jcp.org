At the JAIN Community meeting in Austin, Texas in November 2002,
Sun expressed its decision to withdraw support for JAIN SPA, the
industry standard Java technology realisation of OSA/Parlay. The
primary reasons for this decision are as follows:

         * Lack of adoption and deployment of JAIN SPA due to slow
           standardization.
         * OSA/Parlay specific Java APIs can be generated directly from
           the Parlay Java API rulebook.
         * Vendors are likely to claim compliance to the Parlay Java
           rulebook interpreted Java APIs, without developing
           compliance tools (TCKs) and reference implementations (RIs).
         * There are numerous Parlay products available today and JAIN
           SPA standardization is significantly behind those
           implementations.

 And the following decisions at the last Parlay meeting in Bangkok:

     Java Work Group will monitor the generation of CRs for Parlay/OSA
     specifications

         * CRs will effectively transition the Rulebooks to the JWG
         * Submit technical content into the JWG San Diego (May) meeting

     Java Work Group will monitor the transition

     The production of the Java code, jar files, Javadoc and automation
     tool artefacts as CRs into the JWG is the responsibility of member
     companies

         * Submit technical content into the JWG San Diego (May) meeting


 I see no reason to carry on with this expert group as all the work that
 we were undertaking will now be done within the joint Parlay/3GPP/ETSI
 working group. I am not aware that the withdrawal of this JSR will
 damage any company implementation/project plans, so I believe the time
 is right for withdrawal.
