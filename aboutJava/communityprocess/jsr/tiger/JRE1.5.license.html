<pre>                                       Sun Microsystems, Inc.<br>                                    Binary Code License Agreement<br><br>     READ THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY PROVIDED SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE TERMS (COLLECTIVELY<br>     "AGREEMENT") CAREFULLY BEFORE OPENING THE SOFTWARE MEDIA PACKAGE.  BY OPENING THE SOFTWARE<br>     MEDIA PACKAGE, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.  IF YOU ARE ACCESSING THE<br>     SOFTWARE ELECTRONICALLY, INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS BY SELECTING THE "ACCEPT"<br>     BUTTON AT THE END OF THIS AGREEMENT.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL THESE TERMS, PROMPTLY<br>     RETURN THE UNUSED SOFTWARE TO YOUR PLACE OF PURCHASE FOR A REFUND OR, IF THE SOFTWARE IS<br>     ACCESSED ELECTRONICALLY, SELECT THE "DECLINE" BUTTON AT THE END OF THIS AGREEMENT.<br><br>     1.  LICENSE TO USE.  Sun grants you a non-exclusive and non-transferable license for the<br>     internal use only of the accompanying software and documentation and any error corrections<br>     provided by Sun (collectively "Software"), by the number of users and the class of<br>     computer hardware for which the corresponding fee has been paid.<br><br>     2.  RESTRICTIONS.  Software is confidential and copyrighted. Title to Software and all<br>     associated intellectual property rights is retained by Sun and/or its licensors.  Except<br>     as specifically authorized in any Supplemental License Terms, you may not make copies of<br>     Software, other than a single copy of Software for archival purposes.  Unless enforcement<br>     is prohibited by applicable law, you may not modify, decompile, or reverse engineer<br>     Software.  You acknowledge that Software is not designed, licensed or intended for use in<br>     the design, construction, operation or maintenance of any nuclear facility.  Sun disclaims<br>     any express or implied warranty of fitness for such uses.  No right, title or interest in<br>     or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name of Sun or its licensors is granted<br>     under this Agreement.<br><br>     3. LIMITED WARRANTY.  Sun warrants to you that for a period of ninety (90) days from the<br>     date of purchase, as evidenced by a copy of the receipt, the media on which Software is<br>     furnished (if any) will be free of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.<br>     Except for the foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS".  Your exclusive remedy and Sun's<br>     entire liability under this limited warranty will be at Sun's option to replace Software<br>     media or refund the fee paid for Software.<br><br>     4.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.  UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED<br>     CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF<br>     MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED,<br>     EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY INVALID.<br><br>     5.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR<br>     ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT,<br>     CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF<br>     LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF<br>     SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  In no event will Sun's liability<br>     to you, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount<br>     paid by you for Software under this Agreement.  The foregoing limitations will apply even<br>     if the above stated warranty fails of its essential purpose.<br><br>     6.  Termination.  This Agreement is effective until terminated.  You may terminate this<br>     Agreement at any time by destroying all copies of Software.  This Agreement will terminate<br>     immediately without notice from Sun if you fail to comply with any provision of this<br>     Agreement.  Upon Termination, you must destroy all copies of Software.<br><br>     7. Export Regulations. All Software and technical data delivered under this Agreement are<br>     subject to US export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in<br>     other countries.  You agree to comply strictly with all such laws and regulations and<br>     acknowledge that you have the responsibility to obtain such licenses to export, re-export,<br>     or import as may be required after delivery to you.<br><br>     8.   U.S. Government Restricted Rights.  If Software is being acquired by or on behalf of<br>     the U.S. Government or by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any<br>     tier), then the Government's rights in Software and accompanying documentation will be<br>     only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with 48 CFR 227.7201 through<br>     227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD) acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212<br>     (for non-DOD acquisitions).<br><br>     9.  Governing Law.  Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California<br>     law and controlling U.S. federal law.  No choice of law rules of any jurisdiction will<br>     apply.<br><br>     10.  Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this<br>     Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless omission would<br>     frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this Agreement will immediately<br>     terminate.<br><br>     11.  Integration.  This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to<br>     its subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written<br>     communications, proposals, representations and warranties and prevails over any<br>     conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or other<br>     communication between the parties relating to its subject matter during the term of this<br>     Agreement.  No modification of this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and<br>     signed by an authorized representative of each party.<br><br>                Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment (J2RE), Standard Edition, Version 1.5<br>                                     SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE TERMS<br><br>     These supplemental license terms ("Supplemental Terms") add to or modify the terms of the<br>     Binary Code License Agreement (collectively, the "Agreement"). Capitalized terms not<br>     defined in these Supplemental Terms shall have the same meanings ascribed to them in the<br>     Agreement. These Supplemental Terms shall supersede any inconsistent or conflicting terms<br>     in the Agreement, or in any license contained within the Software.<br><br>     1. Software Internal Use and Development License Grant. Subject to the terms and<br>     conditions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to Section 4 (Java(TM) Technology<br>     Restrictions) of these Supplemental Terms, Sun grants you a non-exclusive,<br>     non-transferable, limited license to reproduce internally and use internally the binary<br>     form of the Software complete and unmodified for the sole purpose of designing, developing<br>     and testing your Java applets and applications intended to run on the Java platform<br>     ("Programs").<br><br>     2. License to Distribute Software. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,<br>     including, but not limited to Section 4 (Java (TM) Technology Restrictions) of these<br>     Supplemental Terms, Sun grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to<br>     reproduce and distribute the Software in binary code form only, provided that (i) you<br>     distribute the Software complete and unmodified and only bundled as part of, and for the<br>     sole purpose of  running, your Programs, (ii) the Programs add significant and primary<br>     functionality to the Software, (iii) you do not distribute additional software intended to<br>     replace any component(s) of the Software, (iv) you do not remove or alter any proprietary<br>     legends or notices contained in the Software, (v) you only distribute the Software subject<br>     to a license agreement that protects Sun's interests consistent with the terms contained<br>     in this Agreement, and (vi) you agree to defend and indemnify Sun and its licensors from<br>     and against any damages, costs, liabilities, settlement amounts and/or expenses (including<br>     attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with any claim, lawsuit or action by any third<br>     party that arises or results from the use or distribution of any and all Programs and/or<br>     Software, and (vi) include the following statement as part of product documentation<br>     (whether hard copy or electronic), as a part of a copyright page or proprietary rights<br>     notice page, in an "About" box or in any other form reasonably designed to make the<br>     statement visible to users of the Software: "This product includes code licensed from RSA<br>     Data Security".<br><br>     3. License to Distribute Redistributables. Subject to the terms and conditions of this<br>     Agreement, including but not limited to Section 4 (Java Technology Restrictions) of these<br>     Supplemental Terms, Sun grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to<br>     reproduce and distribute the binary form of those files specifically identified as<br>     redistributable in the Software "README" file ("Redistributables") provided that: (i) you<br>     distribute the Redistributables complete and unmodified (unless otherwise specified in the<br>     applicable README file), and only bundled as part of Programs, (ii) you do not distribute<br>     additional software intended to supersede any component(s) of the Redistributables, (iii)<br>     you do not remove or alter any proprietary legends or notices contained in or on the<br>     Redistributables, (iv) you only distribute the Redistributables pursuant to a license<br>     agreement that protects Sun's interests consistent with the terms contained in the<br>     Agreement, (v) you agree to defend and indemnify Sun and its licensors from and against<br>     any damages, costs, liabilities, settlement amounts and/or expenses (including attorneys'<br>     fees) incurred in connection with any claim, lawsuit or action by any third party that<br>     arises or results from the use or distribution of any and all Programs and/or Software,<br>     and (vi) include the following statement as part of product documentation (whether hard<br>     copy or electronic), as a part of a copyright page or proprietary rights notice page, in<br>     an "About" box or in any other form reasonably designed to make the statement visible to<br>     users of the Software: "This product includes code licensed from RSA Data Security".<br><br>     4. Java Technology Restrictions. You may not modify the Java Platform Interface ("JPI",<br>     identified as classes contained within the "java" package or any subpackages of the "java"<br>     package), by creating additional classes within the JPI or otherwise causing the addition<br>     to or modification of the classes in the JPI.  In the event that you create an additional<br>     class and associated API(s) which (i) extends the functionality of the Java platform, and<br>     (ii) is exposed to third party software developers for the purpose of developing<br>     additional software which invokes such additional API, you must promptly publish broadly<br>     an accurate specification for such API for free use by all developers.  You may not<br>     create, or authorize your licensees to create, additional classes, interfaces, or<br>     subpackages that are in any way identified as "java", "javax", "sun" or similar convention<br>     as specified by Sun in any naming convention designation.<br><br>     5. Notice of Automatic Software Updates from Sun.  You acknowledge that the Software may<br>     automatically download, install, and execute applets, applications, software extensions,<br>     and updated versions of the Software from Sun ("Software Updates"), which may require you<br>     to accept updated terms and conditions for installation. If additional terms and<br>     conditions are not presented on installation, the Software Updates will be considered part<br>     of the Software and subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement.<br><br>     6. Notice of Automatic Downloads.
