Proposed Changes for Foundation Profile 1.0b maintenance release
----------------------------------------------------------------

overview.html : Add the following paragraph:
> TCP/IP Server Socket. URIs of the form "socket:// | socket://:{port}"
> must return an object with behavior that follows the
> javax.microedition.io.StreamConnectionNotifier interface specification.
> The streams provided by this connection are functionally equivalent to
> the streams provided by the java.net.Socket class returned by the
> java.net.ServerSocket.accept() method when the ServerSocket(int)
> constructor is used to create the ServerSocket instance.

(Apply proposed changes for Connected Device Configuration 1.0b maintenance release.)
