<div class="header2"><a name="Definitions" id="Definitions"></a>1 DEFINITIONS</div>
<p>The definitions found in the JCP Process Document also apply to this document.</p>
<p>The use of the term <b>day</b> or <b>days</b> in this document refers to calendar 
  days unless otherwise specified.</p>
<div class="header2"><a name="Meetings" id="Meetings"></a>2 EC MEETINGS</div>
<br>
<div class="header3"><a name="Arrangements" id="Arrangements"></a>MEETING ARRANGEMENTS</div>
<p>The Executive Committee of the JCP meets approximately monthly, either 
  in person or in teleconference, to fulfill the responsibilities defined here 
  and in the JCP Process document.</p>
<p>All EC meeting materials, including agendas, presentations, minutes, and attendance 
  statistics, are published on the EC public web site located at <a href="/en/participation/committee">http://jcp.org/en/participation/committee</a>.</p>
<p>In exceptional cases, at the request of an EC member (with no need for a second,) 
  the EC may agree to go into private session in order to cover a specific topic, 
  and only for the duration of that coverage. Private sessions are strongly discouraged. 
  Minutes are taken during private sessions but are not published publicly; this 
  is the only case in which two separate minutes are maintained.</p>
<p> EC meetings are chaired by the Chair, who also keeps minutes. All minutes 
  shall be marked "preliminary, not approved" until 
  approved by the EC at the next meeting. After approval, the minutes shall be 
  marked "approved" and shall be posted to the 
  appropriate web site no later than fourteen calendar days after approval.</p>
<p>EC meetings are conducted in a spirit of collaboration and cooperation, with 
  the goal of reaching broad agreement taking priority over strict adherence to 
  formal procedures.</p>
<p>Attendance at meetings is mandatory:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If possible, a telephone bridge will be provided for the convenience of 
    those who are unable to attend face-to-face meetings in person. However, 
    this will be placed in listen-only mode, permitting remote attendees to listen 
    but not to verbally participate in the meeting. If possible an asynchronous 
    communication mechanism such as a chat room or IRC channel will be provided 
    to enable those who are not physically present to express their views. This 
    will be monitored, but there is no guarantee that comments received in this 
    manner will be addressed in real-time. Remote observers will not be counted 
    as present at the meeting.</li>
  <li>Missing two meetings in a row (whether teleconference or face-to-face meetings) 
    results in the loss of voting privileges in all JSR ballots and EC votes that 
    have not yet started. An EC member who has lost voting privileges cannot make 
    or second a motion. Privileges are regained after full attendance at one 
    meeting.</li>
  <li>Missing more than two-thirds of all meetings 
    in any consecutive twelve-month period, results in loss of EC membership.</li>
  <li>Members who are unable to attend an EC meeting due to extraordinary circumstances 
    may appeal to the Chair for a waiver of the non-attendance penalty. Any such 
    waiver may be granted purely at the Chair's discretion, possibly after consultation 
    with the EC.</li>
  <li>The PMO shall provide regular attendance reports to the EC, and shall issue 
    warnings to those who are at risk of losing membership.</li>
</ul>
<p>Quorum for EC meetings is 75% of EC voting members. 
  In the absence of a quorum 
  the EC may have discussion, but can take no action and make no decision until 
  the next quorate meeting or until an electronic ballot is carried out (see below, 
  Electronic Voting.)</p>
<p>EC meetings must be scheduled at least 10 days in advance for teleconference 
  meetings and at least 30 days in advance for face-to-face meetings, at which 
  time the meeting location must be also announced.</p>
<p>In addition to the regular monthly meetings the ECs shall organize the following 
  meetings with the help of the PMO:</p>
<ol>
  <li> a semi-annual teleconference open to all JCP members. The agenda for this 
    meeting shall incorporate, at the EC's discretion, topics suggested by the 
    membership in response to the meeting invitation, which shall solicit such 
    input with sufficient advance notice, as well as provide clear instructions 
    on how to join the meeting;</li>
  <li> if an appropriate venue is available 
    for co-location, an annual face to face meeting with all JCP members. Whenever 
    possible no fee should be charged for attending this meeting. As above, the 
    agenda for this annual meeting shall include, at the EC's discretion, topics 
    suggested by the membership.</li>
</ol>
<p>To facilitate the organization and receipt of topic suggestions as specified 
  above, and to enable JCP members and the public to provide feedback to the EC, 
  the EC shall set up a (possibly moderated) public mailing list with a corresponding 
  public archive.</p>
<p>EC members shall at all times adhere to the following policies in connection 
  with their JCP activities:</p>
<ol type = a>
  <li>Executive Committee voting members should cast their JSR ballots with the 
    goal of promoting the efficient evolution of the Java platform.</li>
  <li>Any communications among Executive Committee members in the course of their 
    JCP activities should take into account the caveats expressed with respect 
    to antitrust laws in section 6.3, &quot;EC Duties and Responsibilities&quot; 
    of the Process Document, item (11.)</li>
</ol>
<br>
<div class="header3"><a name="Agenda" id="Agenda"></a>AGENDA</div>
<p>The Chair and EC members may submit agenda items (either for discussion of 
  for action) by emailing those items to the EC mailing list at any time. Agenda 
  items shall be scheduled for the next available meeting, depending on availability 
  and timing.</p>
<p>A preliminary agenda must be submitted by the Chair at least 7 days before 
  the meeting. EC members may suggest additional items for the agenda at that 
  time, if they have not already done so in previous meetings or emails.</p>
<p>The Chair should email the final agenda 4 days before a meeting. Absent an 
  agenda, the EC members present at a meeting may agree on one at that time, and 
  proceed accordingly.</p>
<p>The final meeting agenda should clearly identify which items are for discussion 
  and which are for action, and it should be posted to the public site.</p>
<p>Agenda items may be changed or added at the beginning of the meeting if no 
  one disagrees.</p>
<p>Meeting materials (presentations, statistics, documents) must be posted on 
  the EC site (<a href="/en/ec/my">https://jcp.org/en/ec/my</a>) 
  at least 3 calendar days in advance of the meeting. Meeting materials may not 
  be made public until after the meeting, lest they be part of a private session. 
  Otherwise, an agenda item for which its supporting materials are not ready on 
  time may be removed from consideration by the Chair or at the request of an 
  EC member. However, the agenda item may be still considered, with the late materials, 
  if no one disagrees.</p>
<p>Supporting materials for any agenda item may be updated at the beginning of 
  the meeting if no one disagrees.</p>
<p>Agenda items for discussion shall be opened to the floor for discussion and 
  comment.</p>
<p>Agenda items for action shall be opened to the floor for discussion and comment, 
  with the goal being to reach general agreement on the proposed action. When 
  such agreement is reached after a long discussion, the Chair shall present to 
  the EC members a clear statement of what will be recorded in the minutes as 
  the result of such discussion.</p>
<div class="header3"><a name="Voting" id="Voting"></a>VOTING</div>
<p>All JSR ballots shall be conducted electronically, as specified in the JCP 
  Process Document, and the results made public.</p>
<p>All decisions of the EC, except those pertaining to JSRs, should be made by 
  general agreement whenever possible. EC members who disagree with an EC decision 
  but are willing to drop their objection in order to reach general agreement 
  may have a brief statement included in the minutes.</p>
<p>In the absence of general agreement any EC voting member, or the Chair, may 
  request that a vote be conducted.</p>
<p>Any motion on the agenda that cannot be acted on for lack of quorum may be 
  brought to an electronic vote at the request of the proposer, following the 
  process specified in the Section &quot;Electronic Voting.&quot;</p>
<p>All EC decisions are advisory in nature except as they pertain to formal ballots 
  as defined in the Process Document.</p>
<p>The table in Appendix B shall be used as a guide in determining the order of 
  precedence for motions and the voting required for the motion to pass. Electronic 
  voting periods last 14 days except where noted otherwise in this document.</p>
<p>EC voting members may cast three types of votes: "yes", "no" and &quot;abstain.&quot; 
  &quot;No&quot; votes should be accompanied by an explanation of the changes 
  - if any - that would permit a change of the vote to "yes". Abstentions are 
  discouraged but may be used by members who are unwilling to support the motion 
  and who do not wish to block further progress. Abstentions should be accompanied 
  by comments.</p>
<p>For the purpose of calculating the voting result only &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; 
  votes are taken into account.</p>
<p>Except where noted otherwise in this document an EC vote - whether electronic 
  or not - is approved if (a) a majority of the votes cast are "yes" votes, and 
  (b) a minimum of 5 "yes" votes are cast.</p>
<p>The full text of EC motions and the detailed results (including how each member 
  voted) shall be recorded in the meeting minutes.</p>
<div class="header3"><a name="Evotes" id="Evotes"></a>ELECTRONIC VOTING</div>
<p>Although there is a strong preference for in-session voting whenever possible, 
  any EC member may request that a motion be voted on through electronic means. 
  The topic addressed by the motion, as well as the general nature of the motion, 
  must have been discussed at an EC meeting prior to the electronic vote.</p>
<p>An electronic vote can be requested either by proposing a motion during a meeting 
  or by sending an email to the EC mailing list with the words &quot;EC Vote Request&quot; 
  in the subject title. In either case another EC member must second the request. 
  The request must include a clearly labeled motion to be voted on by the EC. 
  It is considered good practice to discuss a motion at an EC meeting, or to circulate 
  it for comment on the EC mailing list, before requesting a vote.</p>
<p>Within 7 days of receipt of the request and the second, the PMO shall send 
  email to the EC mailing list starting the electronic vote on the motion. The 
  voting period duration is 14 days to ensure that all voting members have time 
  to consider the motion before voting.</p>
<p>The PMO may conduct the vote by instructing EC voting members to vote through 
  a PMO-provided or designated website or may instruct the EC to vote by email. 
  In either case, EC voting members may change their vote up to the end of the 
  voting period. The PMO tabulates the results.</p>
<p>Options for votes (i.e. yes, no, abstain) and the number of votes needed to 
  pass are the same as during meetings.</p>
<p>The PMO shall report the results within 7 calendar days, either to the EC mailing 
  list or at an EC meeting, at which time the full text of the motion and the 
  detailed results (including how each member voted) shall be recorded in the 
  meeting minutes.</p>
<div class="header2"><a name="AppendixA" id="AppendixA"></a>APPENDIX A: REVISING THIS DOCUMENT</div>
<p>To revise this document, a formal proposal must be submitted to the EC in the 
  form of a Final Draft. The draft shall be published by the PMO for 30 day review 
  during which EC members and the public can comment on the proposal. The EC shall 
  formally track comments as Expert Groups are required to do for JSRs.</p>
<p>At the end of the review period, and after proper disposition of comments and 
  possible revision of the Draft, it shall be subjected to a vote by the EC. 
  In order for the vote to pass, a 
  majority of the votes cast must be "yes", and there must be a minimum of 5 "yes" 
  votes. If the vote fails, revised Final Drafts may be submitted for additional 
  votes at any subsequent time.</p>
