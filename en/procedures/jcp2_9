</p>
<p>
The international Java community develops and evolves Java? technology specifications using the
Java Community Process (JCP.) The JCP produces high-quality specifications using an inclusive,
consensus-based approach that produces a Specification, a Reference Implementation (to prove the
Specification can be implemented,) and a Technology Compatibility Kit (a suite of tests, tools, and
documentation that is used to test implementations for compliance with the Specification.)
</P>
<P>
Experience has shown that the best way to produce a technology specification is to gather a group of
industry experts who have a deep understanding of the technology in question and for a strong
technical lead work with that group to create a first draft. Agreement on the form and content of the
draft is then built using an iterative process that allows an ever-widening audience to review and
comment on the document.
</p>
<p>
An Executive Committee (EC) representing a cross-section of both major stakeholders and other
members of the Java community is responsible for approving the passage of Specifications through
the JCP's various stages and for reconciling discrepancies between Specifications and their
associated test suites. 
</p>
<p>
There are four major stages in this version of the JCP:
<ol>
<li>
INITIATION: A Specification targeted at the desktop/server or consumer/embedded space is
initiated by one or more Members and approved for development by the EC. A
group of experts is formed to assist the Spec Lead with the development of the Specification.
</li>
<li>
DRAFT RELEASES: The Expert Group develops the Specification through an iterative
process, releasing drafts for public review and comment. After the formal Public Review the EC
holds a ballot on whether the JSR should proceed to the Final Release stage.
</li>
<li>
FINAL RELEASE: The Spec Lead submits the Specification to the PMO for publication as the
Proposed Final Draft. When the RI and TCK are completed, and the RI passes the TCK, the
Specification, the RI, and the TCK are submitted to the PMO, which circulates them to the
EC for final approval.
</li>
<li>
MAINTENANCE: The Specification, Reference Implementation, and Technology Compatibility
Kit are updated in response to ongoing requests for clarification, interpretation, enhancements,
and revisions. The EC reviews proposed changes to the Specification and
indicates which can be carried out immediately and which should be deferred to a new JSR.<P>

This version (2.9) of the JCP was developed using the Java Community Process itself by means of JSR
355, led by Oracle with all Executive Committee members forming the Expert Group.

<A NAME="1"></A> <FONT
 SIZE="5">1. GENERAL PROCEDURES </FONT>
</P>
<H3><A NAME="1.1"></A> 1.1 EXPERT GROUP TRANSPARENCY </H3>
<p>
Each Expert Group is free to use the working style that it finds most productive and appropriate, so
long as this is compatible with the requirements specified in this document. For example, an EG may
choose to move forward only when there is general agreement among its members, or by voting on
issues when there is disagreement.
</p>
<p>
As specified below, Expert Groups must operate in a transparent manner, enabling the public to
observe their deliberations and to provide feedback. All feedback must be taken into consideration and
public responses to such feedback must be provided. EGs must maintain a publicly-accessible
document archive from which all of their working materials such as source documents, meeting
agendas and minutes, and draft documents can be downloaded. The EC should take the Expert
Group's transparency record into consideration when voting on its JSR.
</p>
<p>
In the initial JSR submission the Spec Lead must specify the transparency mechanisms (for example,
the communication mechanisms and Issue Tracker) that the Expert Group intends to adopt, and must
provide the URLs for accessing the chosen collaboration tools. The PMO shall publish this information
on the JSR Page. The Spec Lead must also provide a pointer to any Terms of Use required to use the
collaboration tools so that the EC and prospective EG members can judge whether they are
compatible with the JSPA.
</p>
<p>
If the EG changes its collaboration tools during the life of the JSR these changes must be reported to
the PMO, which shall update the relevant information on the JSR Page. Any such changes must
ensure that previously-published information is incorporated into the new tools.
</p>
<p>
When voting to approve a JSR's transition to the next stage, EC members are expected to take into
consideration the extent to which the Spec Lead is meeting the transparency requirements.
</p>
<p>
Spec Leads should be aware of their obligations under the JSPA to license the output of their JSR on
Fair, Reasonable, and Non Discriminatory terms, and to make certain patent grants. Incorporating
feedback provided through public email lists or forums without ensuring that the provider has signed
the JSPA or an equivalent Contribution Agreement may make it impossible to meet these
requirements or may expose the Spec Lead Member to legal liability.
</p>
<p>
The use of Confidential Information (as defined in the JSPA) by Expert Groups limits transparency, is
strongly discouraged, and will be prohibited in a future version of the Process. If the Spec Lead
intends to permit the use of Confidential Information (such as emails, drafts, or submissions marked
as Confidential) this must be specified in the initial Java Specification Request.<a href="#F2"><FONT SIZE="1"><SUP> 2</SUP></FONT></a>
</p>
<H4><A NAME="1.1.1"></A> 1.1.1 PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS </H4>
<p>
Expert Groups may choose to keep purely administrative matters private, but all substantive business
must be performed in a manner that allows the public to observe their work and to respond to it. All
proceedings, discussions, and working documents must be published, and a mechanism must be
established to allow the public to provide feedback. One common way of meeting these requirements
is through the use of mailing lists, but other alternatives such as blogs, Wikis, and discussion forums
may be preferred. Whatever communication mechanisms are chosen, these must include an archiving
function so that a record of all communications is preserved. Archives must be readable by the public.<a href="#F3"><FONT SIZE="1"><SUP> 3</SUP></FONT></a>
</p>

<H4><A NAME="1.1.2"></A> 1.1.2 ISSUE TRACKING </H4>
<p>
Issues must be tracked through a publicly readable Issue Tracker. The Expert Group may choose to
use a publicly writable Issue Tracker, thereby permitting the public to log issues directly, or
alternatively to identify formal comments in some other manner and to enter them into the Issue
Tracker on behalf of the submitter. Whatever mechanism is used, a publicly-readable audit trail of all
comments and Issues must be maintained.
</p>
<p>
Whenever a Spec Lead or a Maintenance Lead submits materials to the PMO for review or ballot they
must also provide an Issue List indicating the disposition of all of the Issues that have been logged
against the JSR. Issues logged late in the review cycle may be deferred for later consideration, and
Issues that are blatantly off-topic or that appear to have been submitted maliciously or erroneously
may be ignored.
</p>
<p>
In order to enable EC members to judge whether Issues have been adequately addressed, the Issue
List must make a clear distinction between Issues that are still open, Issues that have been deferred,
and those that are closed, and must indicate the reason for any change of state.
</p>
<p>
The PMO shall publish the Issue List or a pointer to it together with the other materials.
</p>
<p>
EC members should review the supplied Issue List and take it into consideration when casting their
ballot. If they have any reservations or concerns about a 'yes' vote, or if they wish to vote 'no,' they
should accompany their ballot with comments which reference one or more Issues (perhaps logged by
them) that they would like to see addressed in the future. EC members should vote 'no' if they believe
that the Spec Lead or Maintenance Lead has not adequately addressed all Issues including those that
have been rejected or otherwise closed by the Expert Group.
</p>

<H4><A NAME="1.1.3"></A> 1.1.3 CHANGES TO LICENSING TERMS </H4>
<p>
As described in Section 2.2.1 below, the proposed licensing terms must be disclosed during JSR 
submission. The Specification license must not be modified after initial submission since to do so
could invalidate IP grants. It may be necessary, however, to modify the proposed RI or TCK license.
Any such changes must be disclosed when the Specification is next submitted to the PMO for public
posting or review.
</p>
<p>
For as long as a JSR is licensed and while it is legally possible to do so the Spec Lead Member must
offer the RI and TCK licenses that were published at the time of Final Release, with the exception that
reasonable increases in price are permitted. At subsequent Maintenance Releases alternate RI or
TCK licenses may also be offered so long as all changes are disclosed, but licensees must be free to
choose the original terms if they wish. For example, existing licensees who do not wish to accept a
modified license when required to adopt a newer TCK shall have the option to license the updated
TCK under the previous terms. If a JSR changes hands the new Maintenance Lead Member must
present a license with terms comparable to, or more favorable to licensees than the existing license.
</p>
<p>
When a newer version of a technology is created through a follow-on JSR, the Specification, RI, and
TCK license terms for the new JSR may differ from those offered for the previous JSR, but any such
changes must be disclosed during JSR submission. The original terms for the previous JSR must be
offered for as long as that JSR is licensed.
</p>
<H3><A NAME="1.2"></A> 1.2 EXPERT GROUP MEMBERSHIP </H3>

<H4><A NAME="1.2.1"></A> 1.2.1 EXPERT GROUP COMPOSITION </H4>
<p>
There is no size limit on the Expert Group. The Spec Lead may add additional Experts at any time so
long as existing EG members are consulted. New members may be added, for example, to increase
diversity of opinion.
</p>
<p>
Any JCP Member, Member Representative, or Member Associate may request to join an Expert Group
at any time by submitting their nomination via the online form provided on the JSR Page. Member
Associates, since they are not covered by the JSPA of their organization, must sign the JSPA in their
own right before they will be permitted to join an Expert Group.
</p>
<p>
Details of such requests, including the organizational affiliation of the requester, together with the Spec
Lead's official response, substantive deliberations within the EG about the matter, and any other
official decisions related to EG membership must be published through the EG's public communication
channel. The PMO will ensure that the JSR Page lists the Members who are members of the EG
together with the names of individual Member Representatives or Member Associates where
appropriate.
</p>

<H4><A NAME="1.2.2"></A> 1.2.2 WITHDRAWAL OF AN EXPERT FROM THE EXPERT GROUP </H4>
<p>
An Expert may withdraw from the Expert Group at any time. If the withdrawing Expert is the Spec Lead, the Expert Group, with the help of the PMO, should approach the Member who originally
contributed the Expert, if any, and request them to provide a suitable replacement; if no such
replacement is forthcoming, the Expert Group should choose one of its members as the new Spec
Lead. If the withdrawing Expert is not the Spec Lead, the Spec Lead should approach the Member
who originally contributed the Expert, if any, and work with that organization to find a suitable
replacement. If no replacement is offered or is not otherwise available, the Spec Lead may recruit a
replacement from amongst other Members.
</p>

<H4><A NAME="1.2.3"></A> 1.2.3 DISRUPTIVE, UNCOOPERATIVE OR UNRESPONSIVE EXPERT GROUP MEMBERS </H4>
<p>
There may be rare instances when members of the Expert Group feel that one of their fellow Experts
is not acting in ways that advance the work of the Expert Group, and is being disruptive,
uncooperative or unresponsive. EG members are expected to make a reasonable effort to resolve any
such issues among themselves, with the active help of the Spec Lead. However, if the situation cannot
be resolved in a timely manner, any three members of the EG can approach the Spec Lead and
request that the EG member in question be excluded from further participation in the EG. If the Spec
Lead agrees to the request he can then do so. In the case where the EG Member in question is a
Member Representative, the Spec Lead must first request that the Member replace its representative.
If the Member does not do so in a timely manner, the Spec Lead can exclude the Member itself from
further EG participation. The Spec Lead's decision as to whether or not to exclude can be appealed to
the EC by following the process outlined in Section 1.7, ?Escalation and Appeals?
</p>

<H4><A NAME="1.2.4"></A> 1.2.4 UNRESPONSIVE OR INACTIVE SPEC LEAD </H4>
<p>
There may be rare instances when members of the Expert Group feel that the Spec Lead is not acting
in ways that advance the work of the Expert Group and is being unresponsive or inactive. The EG is
expected to make a reasonable effort to resolve any such issues in a timely manner. However, if the
situation cannot be resolved these concerns should be brought to the attention of the EC as quickly as
possible so they may be proactively addressed and resolved.
</p>
<p>
If the problems cannot be resolved informally, any three members of the EG may request the EC to
replace the Spec Lead. All such requests must clearly state the cause of the concern and provide all
necessary evidence. If the EC agrees that there is cause, it may ask the PMO to replace the Spec
Lead. In the case where the Spec Lead is a Member Representative the PMO shall ask the Member to
replace the Spec Lead. If the Member refuses to do so, the PMO shall seek to put in place an
alternative Spec Lead, in which case the EC must conduct a transfer ballot as specified in section
5.1.2 of this document. If no Spec Lead replacement can be found, the EC shall initiate a JSR
Renewal Ballot to determine whether the JSR should be shut down.
</p>

<H3><a name="1.3"></a>1.3 JSR DEADLINES </H3>
<p>
If a JSR does not begin Early Draft Review within 9 months of completing its JSR Approval Ballot, or
does not begin Public Review within 12 months of first submitting an Early Draft, or does not reach
Final Release within 12 months of commencing Public Review, then the EC should initiate a JSR
Renewal Ballot unless it is agreed that there are extraordinary circumstances that justify the delay. The
PMO shall inform the Spec Lead and Expert Group of this decision and will request the Spec Lead
and Expert Group to prepare a public statement to the EC. The JSR Renewal Ballot shall start 30 days
after the request. If the JSR Renewal Ballot is approved by the EC, then another renewal ballot cannot
be initiated for that JSR for an additional year.
</p>
<p>
If the JSR Renewal Ballot fails, the Expert Group will have 30 days to update the JSR in response to
the concerns raised by the EC, and may submit a revised version to the PMO. If a revised JSR is not
received by the end of the 30 days, the original decision by the EC shall stand and the JSR shall be
closed. If a revision is received, then the PMO shall forward it to the EC and initiate a JSR Renewal
Reconsideration Ballot. At the close of balloting, all comments submitted by EC members, together
with their ballots shall be circulated to the Expert Group by the PMO. If this ballot fails, the JSR shall
be closed and the Expert Group shall disband.
</p>
<p>
If a JSR that is closed through these processes was a revision to an existing Specification, the Spec
Lead shall resume the role of Maintenance Lead of the current Specification.
</p>

<H3><a name="1.4"></a>1.4 COMPATIBILITY TESTING </H3>
<p>
The Spec Lead is responsible for defining the process whereby the TCK is used to certify
implementations of the JSR as compatible. The Maintenance Lead must submit to the PMO at least
quarterly a list of all implementations that have been certified as compatible and that have been
released publicly or commercially. The PMO will publish this information on the JCP Website. If the
Spec Lead submits the information in the form of a pointer to an already published list the PMO may
choose simply to reference that list rather than duplicate it.
</p>
<p>
TCK license terms must permit implementors to freely and publicly discuss the testing process and
detailed TCK test results with all interested parties.
</p>

<H3><a name="1.5"></a>1.5 EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE DUTIES </H3>

<H4><A NAME="1.5.1"></A> 1.5.1 TRANSPARENCY </H4>
<p>
All substantive Executive Committee business should be conducted in the most transparent manner
possible. EC transparency requirements are specified in a separate document, EC Standing Rules.
</p>

<H4><A NAME="1.5.2"></A> 1.5.2 DRAFT REVIEWS </H4>
<p>
During JSR reviews EC members are strongly encouraged to ensure that one or more technical
members of their organizations review the draft and provide feedback using the mechanism specified
by the Spec Lead. EC feedback is particularly important to the Expert Group, and EC members are
encouraged not to wait until ballot periods to raise concerns and issues.
</p>

<H3><a name="1.6"></a>1.6 PMO RESPONSE TIMES </H3>
<p>
Materials to be posted on the JCP Website for review, comment, or any other official EG or EC
business should be submitted to the PMO, which shall post them on the JCP Website and announce
their availability to Members and the public within seven days of receipt (holiday closures excepted.)
</p>

<H3><a name="1.7"></a>1.7 ESCALATION AND APPEALS </H3>
<p>
Unless otherwise specified in this document, any EG member can appeal to the EC regarding a
decision, an action, or inaction by the PMO, a Spec Lead, or a Maintenance Lead that affects EG
participation or issue-resolution and which cannot be resolved by other reasonable means. An appeal
must be initiated by sending an email message to the PMO (pmo@jcp.org) in all cases, even if it
affects the PMO itself. The message must describe the issue under appeal clearly and concisely, with
a short and relevant subject line, and must provide all relevant documentation to support the appeal.
The PMO shall transmit the message to the EC no later than seven days after receipt. The EC shall
then respond to the appellant within 30 days, either with a resolution or with a request for clarification
and/or further documentation.

 SIZE="5">2. INITIATE A NEW OR REVISED SPECIFICATION </FONT>
</P>
<H3><A NAME="2.1"></A> 2.1 INITIATE A JAVA SPECIFICATION REQUEST </H3>
<p>
One or more Members may initiate a request to develop a new Specification, or carry out a significant
revision to an existing one, by submitting a JSR proposal through the JCP Website, as described in
the <a href="http://jcp.org/en/resources/guide">Spec Lead Guide</a>. Upon request to the PMO any JSR proposal may be withdrawn by the
submitter(s) without explanation prior to the completion of the JSR Approval Ballot.
</p>
<p>
The following information must be provided with each JSR:
<ul>
<li>the Members making the request (the submitters,) the proposed Spec Lead, and the initial members of the Expert Group,</li>
<li>a description of the proposed Specification,</li>
<li>the reason(s) for developing or revising it,</li>
<li>the primary Platform Edition, as well as any consideration given to other Platform Editions,</li>
<li>an estimated development schedule,</li>
<li>any preexisting documents, technology descriptions, or implementations that might be used as a starting point,</li>
<li>a transparency plan, which outlines the tools and techniques that the Spec Lead will use during the development of the Specification to communicate with and seek feedback from JCP Members and the public.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<H4><A NAME="2.1.1"></A> 2.1.1 REVISE EXISTING SPECIFICATIONS </H4>
<p>
Existing Specifications, together with their associated RIs and TCKs, are maintained by a designated
Maintenance Lead using the processes described in section 5 of this document. Maintenance Lead
Members are expected to assume long term ownership of the Specification, RI, and TCK while
respecting the wishes of JCP Members with regard to evolution. Maintenance Leads shall therefore be
the Spec Leads for all significant revisions to their Specifications, but they shall not have the exclusive
right to decide when a significant revision will take place. That shall be decided by the EC in response
to a revision JSR that can be initiated by any JCP Member. Submitter(s) should make a reasonable
effort to recruit members of the previous Expert Group to join any such revision effort.
</p>

<H4><A NAME="2.1.2"></A> 2.1.2 PROTECT THE INSTALLED BASE AND GUARD AGAINST FRAGMENTATION </H4>
<p>
Changes to the Java programming language, the Java virtual machine (JVM,) the Java Native
Interface (JNI,) packages in the "java.*" space, or other packages delivered only as part of Java SE,
have the potential to seriously disrupt the installed base if carried out inconsistently across the
Platform Editions. In order to protect the installed base, any such changes can only be accepted and
carried out within a UJSR for Java SE.
</p>
<p>
In order to guard against fragmentation, new Platform Edition Specifications must not substantially
duplicate existing Platform Editions or Profiles.
</p>

<H4><A NAME="2.1.3"></A> 2.1.3 PROFILES AND API SPECIFICATIONS TARGET CURRENT PLATFORM EDITIONS </H4>
<p>
All new or revised Specifications must be compatible with the most recent versions of the targeted
Platform Edition Specifications. In order to achieve this, all UJSRs to define new Profile Specifications
or revise existing Profile Specifications must reference either the most recent Release version of the
Platform Edition Specification they are based upon or a newer version of that Specification that is
under development via an active UJSR.
</p>

<H4><A NAME="2.1.4"></A> 2.1.4 PLATFORM INCLUSION </H4>
<p>
The JSR submission form requires the submitter to state whether the JSR's RI and TCK should be
delivered as part of a Profile or Platform Edition, in standalone manner, or both. The final decision as
to whether a specific JSR is included in a Profile or a Platform Edition is made by the Spec Lead and
Expert Group of the Platform Edition or Profile JSR, and is confirmed by the EC ballots on the relevant
JSR. If the Spec Lead for the Platform Edition or Profile JSR turns down a request for inclusion then
the JSR must deliver a standalone RI and TCK.
</p>
<p>
Technologies may be incorporated into a Profile or Platform Edition after having been initially delivered
standalone. A JSR for a new version of an API that proposes to become part of a Profile or Platform
Edition and is considering discontinuing standalone availability must state the rationale for this change
and must inform the public of the intention to discontinue the availability of the standalone RI, and TCK
one JSR submission in advance.
</p>

<H3><A NAME="2.2"></A> 2.2 JSR REVIEW </H3>
<p>
When a JSR is received, the PMO shall give it a tracking number, 
create its JSR Page, announce the proposed
JSR to the public, and begin JSR Review. Comments on the JSR should be sent to the JSR's public
feedback communication mechanism. Comments shall be forwarded to the EC for its consideration
and shall be made available from the JSR Page (similar comments may be consolidated.) Members
who are interested in joining the Expert Group (should the JSR be approved) should identify
themselves by submitting a nomination form to the PMO.
</p>

<H4><A NAME="2.2.1"></A> 2.2.1 DISCLOSURE OF LICENSING TERMS </H4>
<p>
The Spec Lead Member is responsible for developing the Reference Implementation and Technology
Compatibility Kit and for licensing them as described in the JSPA. The Spec Lead Member must
provide the EC with complete copies of the proposed Specification, RI, and TCK licenses no later than
the start of JSR Review. The licenses shall be published on the JSR page. EC members should
provide feedback on the terms as an indication of how the community as a whole might react to the
terms. If EC members believe that the proposed licensing terms are not compatible with the licensing
guidelines established for use within the JCP, then balloting on the proposed JSR shall be delayed
until Oracle legal provides an opinion on the matter.
</p>

<H3><A NAME="2.3"></A> 2.3 JSR APPROVAL BALLOT </H3>
<p>
After the JSR Review, EC members shall review the JSR and any comments received, and cast their
ballot to decide if the JSR should be approved.
</p>
<p>
If the JSR Approval Ballot fails, the PMO shall send all EC comments to the JSR submitter(s) who may
revise the JSR and resubmit it within 14 days. If a revised JSR is not received in that time, the original
EC decision shall stand and the JSR shall be closed. If a revised JSR is received, the PMO shall post
it to the JSR Page, announce the revised JSR to the public, and send it to all EC members for a JSR
Reconsideration Ballot. If that ballot fails, the JSR shall be closed.
</p>

<H3><A NAME="2.4"></A> 2.4 FORM THE EXPERT GROUP </H3>
<p>
When a JSR is approved the PMO instructs the identified Spec Lead to form the Expert Group. If the
Member contributing the Spec Lead withdraws from the JCP before the JSR is approved, the PMO
shall request the preliminary Expert Group to choose a replacement from among themselves who is
willing to take on the duties defined in this document.
</p>

<A NAME="3"></A> <FONT
 SIZE="5">3. DRAFT RELEASES </FONT>
</P>
<H3><A NAME="3.1"></A> 3.1 WRITE THE FIRST DRAFT OF THE SPECIFICATION </H3>
<p>
The Expert Group should begin work by considering the requirements set forth in the JSR, any
contributed documents or technology descriptions, comments received during JSR Review and, if this
is a revision of an existing Specification, the Issue List maintained by the Maintenance Lead (see
section 5.) Additional input can be obtained from discussions with other Members, industry groups,
software developers, end-users, and academics. The goal is to define requirements and then write a
draft Specification suitable for review by the community and the public.
</p>
<p>
When the Expert Group decides that the first draft is ready for review, the Spec Lead shall send the
draft, along with any additional files required for review, to the PMO. The Spec Lead should also
suggest the length of the Early Draft Review period if the Expert Group feels it should go beyond the
minimum 30 days.
</p>
<p>
Multiple Early Drafts (and Early Draft Reviews) are encouraged where the Expert Group feels that this
would be helpful.
</p>

<H3><A NAME="3.2"></A> 3.2 EARLY DRAFT REVIEW </H3>
<p>
Refinement of the draft Specification begins when the PMO posts it to the JCP Website and
announces the start of Early Draft Review. The goal of Early Draft Review is to get the draft
Specification into a form suitable for Public Review as quickly as possible by uncovering and
correcting major problems with the draft. Early Draft Review is an early-access review, and should
ideally take place when the Specification still has some unresolved issues. The public's participation in
Early Draft Review is an important part of the process since in the past, comments from the public
have raised fundamental architectural and technological issues that have considerably improved some
Specifications.
</p>

<H4><A NAME="3.2.1"></A> 3.2.1 UPDATING THE DRAFT DURING EARLY DRAFT REVIEW </H4>
<p>
If the Expert Group makes major revisions to the draft during Early Draft Review the Spec Lead should
send the revised draft, along with a synopsis of the changes, to the PMO, which shall publish these
online and make them available for download by the public.
</p>
<p>
After the Early Draft Review period has ended, the Expert Group can make any additional changes to
the draft it deems necessary in response to comments before submitting the draft to the PMO for the
next review.
</p>

<H3><A NAME="3.3"></A> 3.3 PUBLIC REVIEW </H3>
<p>
Public Review begins when the PMO posts a new draft Specification on the JCP Website and
announces its availability for public review and comment.
</p>
<p>
The Spec Lead is responsible for ensuring that all comments are read and considered. If those
comments result in revisions to the draft, and those revisions result in major changes (in the opinion of
the Expert Group,) then the Spec Lead must send an updated draft (with a summary of the changes)
to the PMO before the review period ends. The PMO shall post the new draft and the change
summary on the JCP Website and shall notify the public that the new draft is available.
</p>

<H3><A NAME="3.4"></A> 3.4 PUBLIC DRAFT SPECIFICATION APPROVAL BALLOT </H3>
<p>
The Public Draft Specification Approval Ballot starts when the Public Review closes. At the close of
balloting, all comments submitted by EC members with their ballots shall be circulated to the Expert
Group by the PMO.
</p>
<p>
If the Public Draft Specification Ballot fails, the Expert Group will have 30 days to update the draft in
response to the concerns raised by the EC and to submit a revised version to the PMO. If a revised
draft is not received within 30 days, the original decision by the EC shall stand and the JSR shall be
closed. If a revision is received, the PMO shall forward it to the EC and initiate a Public Draft
Specification Reconsideration Ballot. At the close of balloting, all comments submitted by EC members
with their ballots shall be circulated to the Expert Group by the PMO. If this ballot fails, the JSR shall
be closed and the Expert Group shall disband. If the JSR was a revision to an existing Specification,
the Spec Lead shall resume the role of Maintenance Lead of the current Specification (see section 5.)
</p>

<P>
<A NAME="4"></A> <FONT
 SIZE="5">4. FINAL RELEASE </FONT>
</P>
<H3><A NAME="4.1"></A> 4.1 PROPOSED FINAL DRAFT </H3>
<p>
If the Public Draft Specification Approval Ballot (or Reconsideration Ballot) is successful, the Expert
Group shall prepare the Proposed Final Draft of the Specification by completing any revisions it deems
necessary in response to comments received. The Spec Lead shall then send the Proposed Final
Draft to the PMO, which shall post it on the JCP Website for public download.
</p>

<H4><A NAME="4.1.1"></A> 4.1.1 COMPLETE THE RI AND TCK </H4>
<p>
The Spec Lead Member is responsible for the completion of both the RI and the TCK. JSRs that are
targeted at more than one platform are required to support each environment, which may require a separate RI and
TCK for each environment. If the RI and TCK uncover areas of the Specification that were underdefined,
incomplete, or ambiguous, the Spec Lead shall work with the Expert Group to correct those
deficiencies and then send a revised Specification together with a summary of the changes to the
PMO. Information shall be posted to the JCP Website. The Expert Group shall continue to consider
any further comments received during this time.
</p>

<H4><A NAME="4.1.2"></A> 4.1.2 ESTABLISH A FIRST-LEVEL TCK APPEALS PROCESS </H4>
<p>
The Spec Lead is also responsible for establishing a clearly defined First Level TCK Appeals Process
to address challenges to tests contained in the TCK. This process must be described in the TCK
documentation. Implementors who are not satisfied with a first level decision should appeal to the EC
by documenting their concerns in an email message to the PMO. The PMO will circulate the request to
the EC, together with any information received from the ML concerning the rationale for the first-level
decision, and initiate a 7-day Appeal Ballot.
</p>

<H4><A NAME="4.1.3"></A> 4.1.3 UPDATE THE DELIVERABLES IN RESPONSE TO THE APPEAL BALLOT </H4>
<p>
Depending on the nature of the problem, a successful TCK challenge will require updating one or
more of the TCK, the Specification, and the RI. Within 30 days of the close of a successful TCK
Appeal Ballot the Maintenance Lead must update these deliverables as necessary and report the
changes to the PMO when the Specification (if changed) and URLs for the updated RI and/or TCK are
delivered for publication on the JCP Website.
</p>

<H3><A NAME="4.2"></A> 4.2 FINAL APPROVAL BALLOT </H3>
<p>
When the Expert Group is satisfied that the TCK provides adequate test coverage, the RI correctly
implements the Specification, and the RI passes the TCK, the Spec Lead shall send the Final Draft of
the Specification to the PMO together with instructions on how EC members can obtain the RI and
TCK for evaluation. The PMO shall circulate the materials to the EC and initiate the Final Approval
Ballot. At the close of balloting, all EC comments shall be sent to the Expert Group by the PMO.
</p>
<p>
The TCK submitted as part of the Final Draft must meet the following requirements:
<ul>
<li>Include documentation covering configuration and execution of the TCK, any other information
needed to use the TCK (e.g. documentation for any supplied tools,) a definition and
explanation of the First-level TCK Appeals Process, and the compatibility requirements that
must be met in addition to passing the TCK tests</li>
<li>The compatibility requirements at a minimum must specify that all compatible implementations
	<ul>
	<li>a) fully implement the Spec(s) including all required interfaces and functionality, and</li>
	<li>b) do not modify, subset, superset, or otherwise extend the Licensor Name Space, or include
any public or protected packages, classes, Java interfaces, fields or methods within the
Licensor Name Space other than those required/authorized by the Specification or
Specifications being implemented.</li>
	</ul>
These requirements must apply unless the Specification or TCK explicitly allows exceptions.</li>
<li>Be accompanied by a test harness, scripts or other means to automate the test execution and
recording of results.</li>
<li>Include a TCK coverage document that will help EC members to evaluate the TCK's quality.
This document should include an overview of the documentation included in the TCK, a
description of means used to validate the quality of the TCK, the criteria used to measure TCK
test coverage of the Specification, test coverage numbers achieved, and a justification for the
adequacy of TCK quality and its test coverage.</li>
<li>Provide 100% signature test coverage. These tests must ensure that all of the API signatures
required by the Specification are completely implemented and that only API signatures required
by the Specification are included in the JSR's namespace.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
If the Final Approval Ballot fails, the Spec Lead will have 30 days to revise the Specification, RI, and
TCK in response to EC concerns and to resubmit modified materials to the PMO.
</p>
<p>
If no responses are received within 30 days the original decision of the EC shall stand, the PMO shall
close the JSR, and the Expert Group shall disband. If the JSR was a revision to an existing
Specification, the Spec Lead shall resume the role of Maintenance Lead of the current Specification
(see section 5.)
</p>
<p>
If a response is received, the PMO shall circulate it to all EC members for a Final Approval
Reconsideration Ballot. At the close of balloting, all ballot comments submitted by EC members shall
be circulated to the Expert Group by the PMO. If the reconsideration ballot fails, the JSR will be closed
and the Expert Group will disband. If the JSR was a revision to an existing Specification, the Spec
Lead will resume the role of Maintenance Lead of the current Specification.
</p>

<H3><A NAME="4.3"></A> 4.3 FINAL RELEASE </H3>
<p>
Within 14 days of a successful Final Approval Ballot or Reconsideration Ballot, the PMO shall publish
on the JCP Website the Specification and links to information on how to obtain the RI and TCK, and
shall announce the availability of these materials to both Members and the public. The published TCK
information must include a means for any interested party to obtain a copy of the TCK documentation
at no charge. Upon Final Release, the Expert Group will have completed its work and disbands. The
Spec Lead will typically become the Maintenance Lead and may call upon Expert Group members and
others for aid in that role.
</p>
<p>
The Maintenance Lead must ensure that the links to the RI and TCK remain valid. If the links become
broken or non-functional the Maintenance Lead will have 30 days following notification from the PMO
to correct them. If the problems are not corrected the PMO will initiate a JSR Withdrawal Ballot (if no
Maintenance Release has been completed) or a Maintenance Release Withdrawal Ballot (if a
Maintenance Release has been made) to determine whether the Maintenance Lead shall be judged to
have abandoned the JSR. If the ballot passes the JSR itself or the relevant Maintenance Release will
be marked as withdrawn.
</p>

<br>
<P>
<A NAME="5"></A> <FONT
 SIZE="5">5. MAINTENANCE </FONT>
</P>

<H3><A NAME="5.1"></A>5.1 MAINTENANCE LEAD RESPONSIBILITIES </H3>
<p>
The Maintenance Lead Member is expected to assume long term ownership of the Specification, RI,
and TCK while respecting the wishes of the JCP Members with regard to evolution. A Maintenance
Lead shall therefore automatically be the Spec Lead for all significant future revisions to their
Specification but shall not have the exclusive right to decide when a significant revision will take place
(see section 2.1.1.)
</p>
<p>
The public may submit requests for clarification, interpretation, and enhancements to the Specification
by logging issues through the JSR's Issue Tracker.
</p>
<p>
The ML shall consider all requests and shall decide how and if the Specification should be updated in
response. The ML is not required to perform these tasks alone, but is free to consult with the former
members of the Expert Group, or any other sources, to assist with the Maintenance duties.
</p>
<p>
All changes proposed by the ML shall make their way into the Specification either through the
Maintenance Release process (described below) or through a new JSR. Changes appropriate for a
Maintenance Release include bug-fixes, clarifications of the Specification, changes to the
implementation of existing APIs, and implementation-specific enhancements. Changes introduced in
Maintenance Releases ? for example, modifications to existing APIs or the addition of new APIs - must
not break binary compatibility as defined by the Java Language Specification. Changes that would
break binary compatibility should therefore be deferred to a new JSR.
</p>

<H4><A NAME="5.1.1"></A> 5.1.1 RELINQUISHING OWNERSHIP </H4>
<p>
If the Maintenance Lead decides to discontinue his or her work at any time (including discontinuing
maintenance activities or declining to take on the role of Spec Lead during a significant revision
initiated by a new JSR) the ML, with the assistance of the PMO, should make a reasonable effort to
locate another Member who is willing to take on the task. If a replacement is identified the PMO must
initiate a Transfer Ballot within 30 days to enable EC members to approve the transfer of
responsibilities. If the ballot succeeds, the new ML must assume his or her responsibilities within 30
days.
</p>
<p>
If no replacement can be found, or if the Transfer Ballot fails, then the PMO shall declare the
Specification to be Dormant and no further maintenance can be carried out. No further Transfer Ballots
will be initiated by the PMO unless a Member volunteers as ML, in which case the PMO will again
have 30 days to initiate a Transfer Ballot.
</p>

<H3><A NAME="5.2"></A>5.2 MAINTENANCE REVIEW </H3>
<p>
The Maintenance Lead shall document all proposed Specification changes through the Issue Tracker
and then send a request to the PMO to initiate a Maintenance Review. This request must be
accompanied by an Issue List that summarizes all formal comments that have been received and that
indicates the disposition of each Issue. The Maintenance Lead must also supply a summary of the
proposed Specification changes, ideally in the form of a diff between the proposed and the current
Specification. The Maintenance Lead must also provide an estimate of when the final materials for the
Maintenance Release will be delivered. If no estimate is provided the deadline will default to 30 days.
</p>
<p>
The PMO shall post the materials on the JCP Website for public review. The Maintenance Lead may
choose to modify one or more of the proposed changes based on comments received during the
review.
</p>
<p>
At the close of the Maintenance Review the PMO shall initiate a 7-day Maintenance Review Ballot.
During this ballot EC members should vote 'yes' if they agree that the Maintenance Release should
proceed as the Spec Lead has proposed, and 'no' if they have objections to the proposed release on
one of the following grounds:
<ul>
<li> One or more of the changes proposed by the Maintenance Lead is inappropriate for a
Maintenance Release and should be deferred to a follow-on JSR.
<li> An issue that was referenced in a "conditional yes" vote during an earlier development stage
has not been addressed.
<li> The proposed Maintenance Release date is too far in the future. (EC members should bear in
mind that many Maintenance Releases need to be synchronized with updates to a Platform,
and that a Maintenance Review may therefore need to be carried out significantly in advance
of the proposed Platform release.)
<li> Unreasonable changes have been made to the RI or TCK licensing terms.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
'No' votes on other grounds shall be rejected by the PMO and shall be considered as abstentions. All
'no' votes must be accompanied by comments explaining the reason for the vote.
</p>
<p>
If the ballot fails, the Maintenance Lead may make any necessary corrections before requesting
another Maintenance Review and ballot. The process may be repeated any number of times.
</p>

<H3><A NAME="5.3"></A>5.3 MAINTENANCE RELEASE </H3>
<p>
After a successful Maintenance Review Ballot the Maintenance Lead will update the Specification, RI,
TCK, and Issue List as necessary and submit them to the PMO for publication in a Maintenance
Release. The PMO verifies that the necessary changes have been made, and publishes the
Specification, the Issue List, and pointers to the RI and TCK on the JSR Web Page.
</p>
<p>
NOTE: until the Maintenance Release stage is reached any proposed changes should be considered
preliminary and subject to change, and therefore should not be implemented in shipping products.
</p>
<p>
If the Maintenance Lead fails to deliver the final materials within the time-period specified at the
beginning of the Maintenance Review process the PMO shall inform the Maintenance Lead of an
impending Maintenance Renewal Ballot, and shall request the Maintenance Lead to prepare a public
statement to the EC that explains the reason for the delay and provides a new deadline. 30 days after
this request the PMO shall initiate a Maintenance Renewal Ballot to determine whether the deadline
may be extended as requested or whether the previous Maintenance Review should be rescinded and
the Maintenance Lead be required to go through another Maintenance Review.

</ol>
</p>

<H3><A NAME="6.4"></A>6.4 EC SELECTION PROCESS AND LENGTH OF TERM </H3>
<p>
EC members serve two-year terms, which are staggered so that half of the seats are up for
election each year.
</p>
<p>
On the EC there are two Ratified Seats for every Elected Seat (hence 16 Ratified Seats and 8
Elected Seats) plus one permanent seat held by Oracle America, Inc.

<H4><A NAME="6.4.1"></A> 6.4.1 RESIGNATION OF EC SEATS </H4>
<p>
EC members may resign their seats at any time during their term.
</p>
<p>
EC members who fail to remain JCP Members forfeit their EC seat.
</p>
<p>
Seats may also be forfeited due to non-attendance at EC meetings, as specified in the EC Standing Rules.
</p>
<p>
Vacated seats are normally filled for the remainder of their term by a special election ballot that will be
held no later than two months after the resignation (unless the resignation is less than six months
before the next scheduled annual election ballot.) 

</p>

<H4><A NAME="6.4.2"></A> 6.4.2 ELECTION PROCESSES </H4>
<p>
All JCP Members are eligible to vote in ballots for Ratified and Elected Seats subject to the provision
that if a Member has majority-ownership of one or more other Members, then that group of Members
shall collectively have one vote, which shall be cast by the person they designate to be their
representative for the ballot in question.
</p>
<p>
If the PMO has reason to believe that an organization is attempting to influence the outcome of an
election by instructing its Agents how to vote the PMO should take all necessary corrective actions
and then report the matter to the EC for approval.
</p>
<p>
Annual elections for Ratified and Elected Seats shall be held simultaneously. Voting in these elections
shall start in the third week of October.
</p>
<p>
In the interest of promoting transparency and participation in the election process the PMO shall
organize teleconferences at which the Members have an opportunity to hear from and to ask
questions of the candidates. If a suitable venue such as JavaOne is available the PMO shall also
organize a public meeting with the same purpose.
</p>

<H4><A NAME="6.4.3"></A> 6.4.3 SELECTION PROCESS FOR RATIFIED SEATS </H4>
<p>
Members are selected for the Ratified Seats using a ratification ballot which is carried out as follows:
<ul>
<li>The PMO nominates Members to fill the vacant Ratified Seats with due regard for balanced
community and regional representation.</li>
<li>Eligible Members will vote to ratify each nominee over a 14-day ballot period.</li>
<li>A nominee is ratified by a simple majority of those who cast a vote.</li>
<li>If one or more of the nominees are not ratified by the vote, the PMO shall nominate additional
Members as needed and hold additional ratification ballots until the vacant seats are filled.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<H4><A NAME="6.4.4"></A> 6.4.4 SELECTION PROCESS FOR ELECTED SEATS </H4>
<p>
Members are selected for the Elected Seats using an open election process that is carried out as
follows:
<ul>
<li>Four weeks before the voting period the PMO shall post on the public JCP site a complete
description of all materials that candidates will be expected to provide (e.g. any candidate
statements, position papers, etc. that will be posted during the election.)</li>
<li>Four weeks before the ballot period the PMO shall accept nominations for a period of 14 days.
Any Member may nominate themselves except that Agents of JCP Members cannot run for
Elected Seats as individuals and the PMO shall reject such nominations.</li>
<li>Eligible Members may vote for as many nominees as there are vacant Elected Seats over a
14-day ballot period.</li>
<li>The nominees who receive the most votes shall fill the vacant Elected Seats.</li>
<li>If there is only one nominee for an Elected Seat voters shall be given the opportunity to vote
?yes? or ?no? for that candidate. To be elected, the candidate must obtain a simple majority.</li>
<li>If there is no candidate for an elected seat, the ECs may choose to hold this seat open until the
next election.</li>
<li>Ties shall be decided by following the procedure defined in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2777.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2777.txt</a>
and using the calculator provided by W3C in <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/05/rfc2777">http://www.w3.org/2001/05/rfc2777</a>.</li>

</P>
<p>
<ol>
<li>All JSR ballots shall be conducted electronically and the results made public.</li>
<li>JSR ballots last 14 days except where noted in this document.</li>
<li>EC members may cast three types of votes: "yes", "no" and ?abstain?. Explicit abstentions are
strongly discouraged. In the extreme and most undesirable case, an EC member may not
vote at all.</li>
<li>Only "yes" and "no" votes count in determining the result of a JSR ballot.</li>
<li>Any vote may be accompanied by comments (which are are particularly encouraged in the
case of abstentions.) When comments include specific suggestions for change these should
be logged in the Issue Tracker to ensure that they are addressed. "No" votes must be
accompanied by references to the Issue Tracker items (if any) that if resolved would
persuade the member to change the vote to "yes".</li>
<li>JSR ballots are approved if (a) a majority of the votes cast are "yes" votes, and (b) a
minimum of 5 "yes" votes are cast. Ballots are otherwise rejected.</li>
<li>Ballots to approve UJSRs that define the initial version of a new Platform Edition Specification
or JSRs that propose changes to the Java language are approved if (a) at least a two-thirds
majority of the votes cast are "yes" votes, (b) a minimum of 5 "yes" votes are cast, and (c)
Oracle casts one of the "yes" votes. Ballots are otherwise rejected.</li>
<li>When a failed JSR ballot results in the closing of a JSR, at least 30 days must pass before
the JSR can be re-initiated.</li>
<li>EC ballots to override a first-level decision on a TCK challenge are approved if (a) at least a
two-thirds majority of the votes cast are "yes" votes, and (b) a minimum of 5 "yes" votes are
cast.</li>

<ol>
<li>Only EC members can initiate a JSR to revise one of these documents.</li>
<li>The EC must approve the JSR.</li>

<A NAME="B"></A> <FONT SIZE="5">V APPENDIX B: TRANSITIONING TO A MERGED EC</FONT>
</P>

<p>
In the previous version (2.8) of this Process Document there were two separate Executive
Committees, one for Java ME and one for Java SE and Java EE combined. The single Executive
Committee described in this version of the Process Document will be implemented through the
following process:
<ul>
<li> The 2012 annual elections will be held as defined in JCP 2.8, but candidates will be informed
that if they are elected their term will be for only a single year, since all candidates must stand
for re-election in 2013.</li>
<li> Immediately after the 2012 election the two ECs will be merged. Oracle and IBM's second
seats will be eliminated, resulting in a single EC with 30 members.</li>
<li> All subsequent JSR ballots (even for in-progress JSRs) will then be voted on by the merged
EC.</li>
<li> For the 2013 annual elections three Ratified and two Elected Seats will be eliminated, thereby
reducing the EC to 25 members. All 25 seats will be up for re-election in 2013.</li>
<li> Members elected in 2013 will be ranked to determine whether their initial term will be one or
two years. The 50% of Ratified and 50% of Elected members who receive the most votes will
serve an initial two-year term, while all others will serve an initial one year term.</li>
<li> All members elected in 2014 and subsequently will serve a two-year term.</li>
</ul><P>

For clarity, note that the provisions specified in this version of the Process Document regarding a
