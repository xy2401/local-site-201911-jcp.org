<P>

<a name="defs"></a><div class="header4">DEFINITIONS</div><P>

The definitions found in the JCP Process Document also apply to this document.<P>

The use of the term <b>day</b> or <b>days</b> in this document refers to calendar days unless otherwise specified.<P>

<a name="meetings"></a><div class="header4">EC MEETINGS</div><P>
<a name="arrangements"></a><div class="header4">MEETING ARRANGEMENTS</div><P>
The Executive Committees of the JCP meet jointly about once a month, either in person or in
teleconference, to fulfill the responsibilities defined here and in the JCP Process document.
All EC meeting materials, including agendas, presentations, minutes, and attendance statistics, are
published on the EC public web site located at <a href="/en/participation/committee">http://jcp.org/en/participation/committee</a><P>

In exceptional cases, at the request of an EC member (with no need for a second,) an EC may agree to go
into private session in order to cover a specific topic, and only for the duration of that coverage. Private
sessions are strongly discouraged. Minutes are taken during private sessions but are not published
publicly; this is the only case in which two separate minutes are maintained.<P>

EC meetings are chaired by the Chair, who also keeps minutes. All minutes shall be marked "preliminary,
not approved" until approved by the EC at the next meeting. After approval, the minutes shall be marked
"approved" and shall be posted to the appropriate web site no later than fourteen calendar days after
approval.<P>
EC meetings are conducted in a spirit of collaboration and cooperation, with the goal of reaching broad
agreement taking priority over strict adherence to formal procedures.<P>

Attendance at meetings is mandatory:
<ul>
<li>Missing two meetings in a row (whether teleconference or face-to-face meetings) results in the loss
of voting privileges in all JSR ballots and EC votes that have not yet started. An EC member who
has lost voting privileges cannot make or second a motion. Privileges are regained after full
attendance at two consecutive meetings.
<li>Missing five meetings in a row, or missing more than two-thirds of all meetings in any consecutive
twelve-month period, results in loss of EC membership.
<li>The PMO shall provide regular attendance reports to the EC, and shall issue warnings to those who are
at risk of losing membership.
<li>Under exceptional circumstances, to be determined on a case-by-case basis, the EC may waive either
of the above penalties.
</ul>
<BR>

Quorum for EC meetings is 75% of EC voting members for each EC (in other words, 75% of the voting
members of each EC must be present, rather than 75% of the total voting membership.) It is possible for
one EC to be quorate and the other not. Depending on the matter under consideration the Chair may deem
it appropriate for the quorate EC to conduct a vote. Otherwise, in the absence of a quorum the EC may
have discussion, but can take no action and make no decision until the next quorate meeting or until an
electronic ballot is carried out (see below, Electronic Voting.)<P>

EC meetings must be scheduled at least 10 days in advance for teleconference meetings and at least 30
days in advance for face-to-face meetings, at which time the meeting location must be also announced.

In addition to the regular monthly meetings the ECs shall organize the following meetings with the help of
the PMO:
<ol>
<li>a semi-annual teleconference open to all JCP members. The agenda for this meeting shall
incorporate, at the EC's discretion, topics suggested by the membership in response to the meeting
invitation, which shall solicit such input with sufficient advance notice, as well as provide clear
instructions on how to join the meeting;
<li>if an appropriate venue such the JavaOne conference or equivalent is available for co-location, an
annual face to face meeting with all JCP members. Whenever possible no fee should be charged
for attending this meeting. As above, the agenda for this annual meeting shall include, at the EC's
discretion, topics suggested by the membership.
</ol>

To facilitate the organization and receipt of topic suggestions as specified above, and to enable JCP
members and the public to provide feedback to the EC, the EC shall set up a (possibly moderated) public
mailing list with a corresponding public archive.
<P>

EC members shall at all times adhere to the following policies in connection with their JCP activities:
<ol type=a>
<li>Executive Committee voting members should cast their JSR ballots with the goal of promoting the
efficient evolution of the Java platform.
<li>Any communications among Executive Committee members in the course of their JCP activities
should take into account the caveats expressed with respect to antitrust laws in section 6.3, "EC
Duties and Responsibilities" of the Process Document, item (11.)
</ol>
<P>

<a name="agenda"></a><div class="header4">AGENDA</div><P>
The Chair and EC members may submit agenda items (either for discussion of for action) by emailing
those items to the EC mailing list at any time. Agenda items shall be scheduled for the next available
meeting, depending on availability and timing.<P>

A preliminary agenda must be submitted by the Chair at least 7 days before the meeting. EC members may
suggest additional items for the agenda at that time, if they have not already done so in previous meetings
or emails.<P>

The Chair should email the final agenda 4 days before a meeting. Absent an agenda, the EC members
present at a meeting may agree on one at that time, and proceed accordingly.<P>

The final meeting agenda should clearly identify which items are for discussion and which are for action,
and it should be posted to the public site.<P>

Agenda items may be changed or added at the beginning of the meeting if no one disagrees.<P>

Meeting materials (presentations, statistics, documents) must be posted on the EC site at least 3 calendar days in advance of the meeting. Meeting materials may not be
made public until after the meeting, lest they be part of a private session. Otherwise, an agenda item for
which its supporting materials are not ready on time may be removed from consideration by the Chair or at
the request of an EC member. However, the agenda item may be still considered, with the late materials, if
no one disagrees.<P>

Supporting materials for any agenda item may be updated at the beginning of the meeting if no one
disagrees.<P>

Agenda items for discussion shall be opened to the floor for discussion and comment.<P>

Agenda items for action shall be opened to the floor for discussion and comment, with the goal being to
reach general agreement on the proposed action. When such agreement is reached after a long
discussion, the Chair shall present to the EC members a clear statement of what will be recorded in the
minutes as the result of such discussion.<P>

<a name="voting"></a><div class="header4">VOTING</div><P>

All JSR ballots shall be conducted electronically, as specified in the JCP Process Document, and the
results made public.<P>

All decisions of the EC, except those pertaining to JSRs, should be made by general agreement whenever
possible. EC members who disagree with an EC decision but are willing to drop their objection in order to
reach general agreement may have a brief statement included in the minutes.<P>

In the absence of general agreement any EC voting member, or the Chair, may request that a vote be
conducted.<P>

Any motion on the agenda that cannot be acted on for lack of quorum may be brought to an electronic vote
at the request of the proposer, following the process specified in the Section "Electronic Voting".
All EC decisions are advisory in nature except as they pertain to formal ballots as defined in the Process
Document.<P>

The table in Appendix B shall be used as a guide in determining the order of precedence for motions and
the voting required for the motion to pass. Electronic voting periods last 14 days except where noted
otherwise in this document.<P>

EC voting members may cast three types of votes: "yes", "no" and "abstain". "No" votes should be
accompanied by an explanation of the changes -- if any -- that would permit a change of the vote to "yes".
Abstentions are discouraged but may be used by members who are unwilling to support the motion and
who do not wish to block further progress. Abstentions should be accompanied by comments.<P>

For the purpose of calculating the voting result only "yes" and "no" votes are taken into account.
Except where noted otherwise in this document an EC vote -- whether electronic or not - is approved if (a) a
majority of the votes cast are "yes" votes, and (b) a minimum of 5 "yes" votes are cast.<P>

The full text of EC motions and the detailed results (including how each member voted) shall be recorded in
the meeting minutes.<P>

<a name="evoting"></a><div class="header4">ELECTRONIC VOTING</div><P>
Although there is a strong preference for in-session voting whenever possible, any EC member may
request that a motion be voted on through electronic means. The topic addressed by the motion, as well as
the general nature of the motion, must have been discussed at an EC meeting prior to the electronic vote.
An electronic vote can be requested either by proposing a motion during a meeting or by sending an email
to the EC mailing list with the words "EC Vote Request" in the subject title. In either case another EC
member must second the request. The request must include a clearly labeled motion to be voted on by the
EC. It is considered good practice to discuss a motion at an EC meeting, or to circulate it for comment on
the EC mailing list, before requesting a vote.<P>

Within 7 days of receipt of the request and the second, the PMO shall send email to the EC mailing list
starting the electronic vote on the motion. The voting period duration is 14 days to ensure that all voting
members have time to consider the motion before voting.<P>

The PMO may conduct the vote by instructing EC voting members to vote through a PMO-provided or
designated website or may instruct the EC to vote by email. In either case, EC voting members may
change their vote up to the end of the voting period. The PMO tabulates the results.<P>

Options for votes (i.e. yes, no, abstain) and the number of votes needed to pass are the same as during
meetings.<P>

The PMO shall report the results within 7 calendar days, either to the EC mailing list or at an EC meeting,
at which time the full text of the motion and the detailed results (including how each member voted) shall be
recorded in the meeting minutes.<P>

<a name="revising"></a><div class="header4">APPENDIX A: REVISING THIS DOCUMENT</div><P>

To revise this document, a formal proposal must be submitted to the EC in the form of a Final Draft. The
draft shall be published by the PMO for 30 day review during which EC members and the public can
comment on the proposal. The EC shall formally track comments as Expert Groups are required to do for
JSRs.<P>

At the end of the review period, and after proper disposition of comments and possible revision of the Draft,
it shall be subjected to a vote by both ECs. In order for the vote to pass, for each EC the following must be
true: (a) a majority of the votes cast are "yes", and (b) there is a minimum of 5 "yes" votes. If the vote fails,
revised Final Drafts may be submitted for additional votes at any subsequent time.<P>
