            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart and Danny Coward divided work on
  JSR 53 to produce two closely related specifications on JavaServer
  Pages (JSP) 1.2 and Java Servlet 2.3 technology. To keep their large
  group of over 30 global corporate and individual participants on
  track, the spec leads relied on tools and processes that extended
  beyond the basic infrastructure provided by the Java Community
Process<sup><font size="-2">SM</font></sup> (JCP) Program.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No doubt about it: running an expert group in order to produce a
  useful Java specification according to the rules and expectations set
  forth by the JCP is a challenging,
  time-consuming, creative endeavor. Resulting specifications typically
  must satisfy demanding commercial interests as well as the open
  source requirements of independent consultants and book authors.
 <P> 
  The JCP's helpful infrastructure can carry an expert group quite far
  down the road to address these needs. But what happens when an expert
  group inevitably runs beyond well-marked territory? That is precisely
  where the rubber meets the road.
 <P> 
  <B>Two Heads Better Than One</b>
 <P> 
  Some expert groups such as those for the Enterprise JavaBeans<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup>
  specification and for the Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition
(J2EE<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup>) platform specification have performed
  more efficiently when two senior people partnered to run them. With
  such co-ownership, each leader's particular skills, talents, and
  experiences can be put to good use. Group members may find a dual
  leadership more responsive and available, as when one is on vacation,
  for instance.
 <P> 
  Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart and Danny Coward, colleagues at Sun
  Microsystems, have formed such a partnership in working with JSR 53.
  In an unusual twist -- approved before an Executive Committee existed
  to question such unique arrangements -- the JSR 53 expert group is
  supposed to produce two specifications primarily because the two are
  closely related, with the JavaServer Pages<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> (JSP(TM))1.2
specification building on the Java Servlet 2.3
  specification. Believing it is "much healthier" to keep
  specifications separate and to create them under different spec
  leads, Pelegri -- the nominal spec lead who also helped design
  the JavaBeans<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> 1.0 and led JavaHelp<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> 1.0 technology -- took
on the JSP 1.2
  specification while Coward addressed the specification on Java
  Servlet 2.3 technology.
 <P> 
  Pelegri's experiences in leading other expert groups made him
  well-suited to lead this one, and Coward's previous work on version
  2.2 of Servlet technology gave him the expertise to guide development
  of the new version and a marked respect toward the Servlet community.
  "I understood my job was not to decide the technology myself but to
  listen to the experts, shepherd their best ideas into the next
  version of the specification, and make sure they ultimately appeared
  in the technology in a way that was agreeable to the whole expert
  group," Coward says.
 <P> 
  When it comes to running the group, Pelegri realizes two heads are
  better than one. "In general, I've found it useful to have Danny
  around to help with everything, from technical feedback to having a
  second perspective on feedback from the experts. We have been
  operating as co-leads from the beginning," says Pelegri. At first,
  Pelegri did administrative JCP work for both specifications, but now
  they co-operate as two sub-expert groups with overlapping
  memberships. "One benefit of our close association is that it is
  easier to catch conflicts across the specifications," Pelegri says.
 <P> 
  <B>Thirty Experts are Better Than Two</B>
 <P> 
  Both Servlet and JSP specifications were served by previous expert
  groups. Everyone still available from those expert groups was invited
  to rejoin the effort. Others were invited who appeared key to
  influencing community adoption, such as book authors, open source
  community members, and consultants who promote and implement the
  technologies that support them. Every container vendor that supports
  JSP or Servlet technology was represented, and tool vendors also
  contributed expertise.
 <P> 
  The recruiting resulted in a large, knowledgeable expert group of
  over 30 participants. "Danny and I accept the tradeoff that a large
  expert group helps with adoption, even though it might be a bit
  harder to manage," Pelegri notes. The difficulty in managing the
  group stems from the experts' uneven participation, which varies
  depending on product cycles, the need for their professional
  expertise, fluctuations in their personal or corporate interest, and
  other things. Some stay involved continuously, but others jump in
  only towards the end.
 <P> 
  Nevertheless, handling a large number of members is a small price to
  pay when the result must be a high quality specification. As Pelegri
  puts it, "The strength of the specification follows from the
  diversity of the expert group membership."
 <P> 
  <B>Email Essential for Large Group</b>
 <P> 
  During each JavaOne, JSR 53 experts are encouraged to mix and mingle
  over a beer. This yearly informal gathering has been effective in
  connecting faces with email addresses. A serious face-to-face meeting
  of everyone would be hard to pull off, and with such a large group,
  teleconferences are also clearly nonworkable. Instead, the group
  communicates by email, generating at times of high activity more than
  100 messages a week.
 <P> 
  While many participants are used to extended email conversations,
  senior employees who rely on conventional meetings typically feel
  overwhelmed by the prolific email threads, Pelegri observes. In fact,
  it took a while for the group as a whole to hit their communication
  stride. To help people with a low tolerance for reading email, the
  spec leads encouraged experts to communicate directly with the lead
  rather than the entire group. Coward and Pelegri quickly learned that
  members in the open source community preferred to air their thoughts
  openly. Soon, the spec leads began encouraging the group-wide dialog,
  and they assumed the extra task of shaping discussions by emailing
  regular summaries to keep every member informed.
 <P> 
  The summaries, discretely organized by topic and identified as
  'Summary of Topic X' in the email header, helped both chatty and
  reticent participants. Another helpful protocol was to label messages
  relating only to one spec as 'JSP' or 'Servlet' to aid those
 restricting their efforts to just one specification. Some experts
  told Coward how much they appreciated how his summaries kept them
  informed without having to read everything.
 <P> 
  Pelegri was pleased with the group's congenial attitude. "In some
  cases opinionated, overall they try to do the right thing for the
  specification and the platform. In most cases they are quite willing
  to share information with each other," says Pelegri.
 <P> 
  Although experts are encouraged to email the group-wide alias for
  issues relevant to everyone, they are still allowed to send private
  messages to the spec lead alias. That alias goes to four people, Sun
 employees all: Pelegri, Coward, and the two leads for the Reference
  Implementation (RI) development team -- Craig McClanahan for the
  Servlet container and Pierre Delisle for the JSP component.
 <P> 
  Email sent to the private alias is not visible to other experts. To
  keep participants from assuming that silence on the group alias means
  there is no feedback on a topic, and to maintain momentum, the
  leaders send summaries of feedback they receive, regardless of the
  source. Their summaries may also include decisions and their
 justification, status reports, and pointers to new specification
  drafts posted to the group's private web site.
 <P> 
  All email is saved to record the history of specification
  development. Email sent to the -experts groupwide alias is archived
  on the group's password-protected public web site while messages sent
  to the -leads alias are auto-archived for the benefit of the four
 leaders. On their own systems, the leaders each keep track of email
  sent directly to them by those circumventing the -leads alias.
 <P>
  <B>Email Poses Unique Challenges</b>
 <P> 
  Email may be an essential venue for communication, but it also poses
  some unique challenges for a spec lead. The sheer volume of email can
  be difficult to handle at times. "With a larger group, there is more
  feedback and more opportunity for people to complain," says Pelegri,
  but eventually experts come to know each other's personal styles well
  enough to maintain perspective and focus.
 <P> 
  Occasionally an email will trigger a large shower of messages.
  Pelegri explains, "If you go away for some period like a long
  weekend, you may come back to a number of mail messages that may have
  changed the direction of a discussion that you as spec lead had
 carefully worked on." Often when discussion gets hyper-active, people
  dive into irrelevant topics in a general free-for-all, Coward says,
  and that is when he sends out a summary message to refocus discussion
  into what is important.
 <P> 

According to Coward, another email challenge stems from the wide
  range in depth of response. Some experts will spend a week mulling
  over an idea and discussing it with colleagues before mailing their
  conclusions in a detailed, thoughtful reply. Other participants may
simply send a comment of "Yep. It's
  fine." or "No, I don't like that-could we change it?" The spec lead
  makes sure ideas of all experts get a fair hearing, whether presented
  formally or in conversation.
 <P> 
  Spec leads of larger groups have greater difficulty tracking people
  who do not respond to direct questions. "The experts we have are
  normally very close to the battlefield, so when they get busy because
 they are close to a deadline, it's hard to get them to respond. What
  I have to do is ping them," says Pelegri. What's easy for a group of
  six, is logistically impossible for a large group. If Pelegri feels
  he must know what members think, he sends a reminder notice. If that
  doesn't work, he asks specific individuals who have particular
  expertise relevant to the topic he's pursuing.
 <P> 
  Occasionally spec leads ask those outside the expert group who have
  expertise but who aren't members. "I have to be careful not to expose
  private information that is happening in the expert group, but in
 some cases there clearly is no privacy issue," says Pelegri, such as
  his own ideas that he's already discussed with the group at large. If
 in doubt, Pelegri consults the expert group about for advice.
 <P> 
  <B>Web Site Infrastructure</b>
 <P> 
  While email is the avenue for multi-expert conversation, web sites
  are useful places to sort and catalog various kinds of data. The
  JCP-supplied page http://jcp.org/jsr/detail/53.jsp allows Pelegri
  and Coward to post messages to their team, but there's no way to add
  related pages yet.
 <P> 
  More interesting is the group's own homegrown web site. "We started
  way before there was anything provided by the JCP. Some of the things
  [such as providing web sites] that the JCP is doing are because we
  did them, and they thought they were good ideas," says Pelegri. Here,
  spec leads post new drafts for review, then send go-get-it email.
  Members can also access status reports, and all drafts and errata, as
 well as lists of members, features to be included, pieces remaining
  for each feature area, outstanding issues, and decisions made. On the
  lighter side, pictures of social interactions at JavaOne and photos
  of individual experts are also posted there.

The web site has turned out to be instrumental in helping orient the
  expert group. Coward understands that people need a picture of where
  they are, where they're headed, what open issues remain, and target
  dates for concluding discussion. "We used this web site
  infrastructure to provide a compass for the unknown terrain we were
 navigating," he says. The lists on the web site also serve to assure
  any expert anxious about resolving a particular feature or issue that
  it has not been forgotten and will eventually be addressed.

 <B> Test Balloons Enable Consensual Decision-Making</b>
 <P> 
  Eventually, issues must resolve into decisions, but that doesn't
  happen automatically. "If summary emails were the only technique a
  spec lead used in an expert group, nothing would ever get decided,"
  says Coward. He maintains the answer lies not in adopting formal
 voting rules, but in floating test balloons to the group. When
  discussion had churned long enough, Coward would summarize
  discussions on a topic, identify solutions to a problem, list his own
  pros and cons for each known option, and indicate the direction he
  considered most useful.
 <P> 
  "I kind of test the expert group and see if anyone likes [the
  suggested direction] or sees problems with it," Coward explains.
  Frequently, the test balloon would mobilize the experts into
  consensus. Such methods worked so well for Coward that only once did
  the experts' opinions split evenly, requiring him to bang the gavel
  and make a final decision for the group. "Making people aware of the
  thought processes behind decisions helps build consensus very
  effectively," Coward says.
 <P> 
 <B> Share Dates to Stay on Schedule</b>
 <P> 
  Coward believes the most important tool for meeting deadlines is to
  keep the entire group informed when drafts are due. If a draft is
  three weeks away, and many issues remain on the table, Coward
  suggests sending a message that rallies the troops around the
  schedule. "If no one knows you're targeting a date, they won't make
  the concerted effort to address the issues. But if people know the
 schedule, they'll work together as a community," Coward says.
 <P> 
  Experts also need to understand what a draft requires. If a spec lead
  says, "We're going to release a public draft in two weeks' time"
  experts might panic, knowing some areas of the spec haven't been
  completed. Because experts don't know the metric for draft readiness,
  they might fail to realize that drafts required by the JCP don't
  necessarily have to be entirely complete. Coward recommends that a
  spec lead allay fears by adding some perspective, as in, "Don't
  worry. We don't have to get through all of these issues by then, but
  I think these pieces are most important. Does everyone agree?"
 <P> 
 <B> Looking Ahead</B>
 <P> 
  Because JSR 53 is subordinate to the J2EE 1.3 platform "umbrella
  spec" JSR 58, neither the JSP spec nor the Servlet spec can go final
  until all other specifications related to J2EE -- including
  J2EE Connector Architecture 1.0 JSR 16 and Enterprise JavaBeans 2.0
JSR 19 -- are also
  ready for release.
 <P> 
  When the specifications go final, Pelegri and Coward are confident
  they will be well-received. "Thirty heads are better than two,"
  Coward still believes. "We work with very bright, very dedicated
  people. If we can get this group to agree on the technology, we can
  be pretty sure that we're doing the right thing." Since these key
  industry leaders and book authors have been involved from the start,
  the entire community can grasp and employ the technology more
  quickly. "They understand the specification, they can evangelize it,
  they can explain it, and they can quickly incorporate it into their
  products," Coward says.
 <P> 
  Eventually, the specifications will undergo another cycle of
  revision. Already, the expert group has begun to think ahead to what
  will be enhanced in the next versions. In terms of process, however,
  Pelegri and Coward have decided to split up the expert group. "At
  first, we thought it would be a bit easier on our resources to deal
  with Servlet and JSP in the same expert group. For next time, though,
  we've decided to divide into two separate expert groups," says
  Pelegri, partly to reduce email traffic somewhat as well as to
  forestall potential difficulties with persuading the Executive
  Committee to approve such a unique setup.
