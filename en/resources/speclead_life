				<strong>Part I, Starting a JSR and Expert Group</strong><br /><br />


			<p>Driving a JSR requires a substantial commitment of time and attention,   which may and probably will go beyond a compensated work activity into a   voluntary labor of love. <br />
              <br />
              Such activity brings its own reward, however. Developers realize they   are extending a technology that will have an impact on engineering   processes or on things people use every day -- phones, televisions, and   navigation systems, for example. <br />

It goes without saying that if a person wants to lead a JSR, he or she   must be prepared and suited for the role of Spec Lead. Star Spec Lead   Linda DeMichiel of Sun Microsystems notes that Spec Leads need   experience with the technology and ability to gather support for the   technology, recruit motivated Experts, guide an international team, and   make appropriate technical decisions in the community&rsquo;s best interest.   She feels that the challenge of developing a Reference Implementation   (RI) and Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) is best met by having &ldquo;an   organization behind you.&quot; <br />
  <br />

<P><BR />Those who are already active Experts or Observers or who are helping   their organizations with the JSR have placed themselves in a good   position to become a future Spec Lead. For example, Ed Burns, a senior   staff engineer at Sun Microsystems, was developing the RI for JSR 127,   Java Server Faces, when he was invited to step up to help the existing   Spec Lead, a Sun colleague. Now Ed is also a Star Spec Lead of JSR 252,   Java Server Faces 1.2. <br />

<P>In the same vein, Antti Rantalahti, a research manager at Nokia Research   Center, was acting as Nokia's technical lead in the Nokia-led JSR 135,   Mobile Media API. He found it &ldquo;quite natural to take on the Spec Lead   responsibilities in the new JSRs in the same content area.&rdquo; He is the   Star Spec Lead for JSR 135, JSR 234, Advanced Multimedia Supplements,   and JSR 272, Mobile Broadcast Service API for Handheld Terminals. <br />

<P>Working for a company that takes its membership in the JCP program to   heart is like being in a Spec Lead incubator. Star Spec Lead Volker   Bauche is a senior software technologist and team lead in the software   technology department of BenQ Corporation. He says BenQ has a team that   manages Java ME standardization, among other tasks. New JSRs to be filed   by BenQ are discussed in the team, and once the content is defined, it   is decided who should become Spec Lead. BenQ Spec Leads are not   permitted to manage more than two JSRs at a time, so the company has a   growing need for new Spec Leads. <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      </p>
<P>Education and training can be helpful credentials. Among the 23 Star   Spec Leads profiled by the JCP PMO, three have the equivalent of a   bachelor&rsquo;s degree, fifteen hold at least one master&rsquo;s degree, and four   have attained PhDs. While upper education is certainly a value add, some   aren&rsquo;t convinced that a formal degree is necessary. In a meritocracy,   Spec Leads gain influence and respect by virtue of their past   contributions, professional knowedge, and skills. In fact, not all Spec   Leads have college degrees. Some are inspired by their own burning   interest in the technology or the industry, a personal motivation that   compels them to do the necessary research and development on their own   or in the context of their day job.

<P>David Nuescheler, the chief technology officer (CTO) of Day Software, is   the Star Spec Lead for JSR 170, Content Repository for Java Technology   API, and JSR 283, Content Repository for Java Technology API Version   2.0. He says, &ldquo;I think the important thing about becoming a Spec Lead is   to be passionate about a topic. Once you are a Spec Lead, other   qualities are required, but I believe my submission was a passionate act   to change something for the better of our industry and standardize the   very many, very different content repository APIs.&rdquo; Although Spec Leads   may represent a company or organization, they are expected to act in the   best interest of the JSR. David believes a Spec Lead needs to be a   mediator and diplomat, &ldquo;trusted by the Expert Group to be neutral.&rdquo; <br />
      <br />
      Passion can help sustain a Spec Lead in what can be a very long road.   Although David initially estimated the JSR 170 effort would take nine   months, someone from the PMO doubled his time frame, but it actually   took a little over four years to complete. And still he came back for   more with JSR 283. <br /><br />

<div class=header3><strong>*Second, Create a New JSR *</strong> </div><br /><br />
  
    If a Spec Lead doesn&rsquo;t somehow inherit a JSR, he or she can come up with   their own. David wanted access to a standardized content repository   interface in Java, but there was none, so he turned to the JCP program,   &ldquo;the ideal standardization body,&rdquo; and submitted his JSR. Antti sees   opportunities on every hand in multimedia, where &ldquo;we just try to provide   Java with the same features the native smart phone applications have. In   the future, it's an issue of how deep the Java application must get into   the system.&rdquo; <br />
    <br />
    Ed Burns suggests asking three questions to identify areas where new   JSRs are needed: Where are customers confused by many similar   technologies or products? Would the Java platform benefit by having a   standard in this space? Would Java license-holders benefit by having a   standard in this space? (Obviously, if a JSR doesn&rsquo;t have buy-in from   major Java licensees, who are typically the primary players in the JCP   program, the technology isn&rsquo;t going anywhere.) <br />
    <br />
    In years past, it was much easier to create new JSRs, Volker says,   because there was so much that was not covered by existing APIs. He   says, &ldquo;Today the problem is not so much to find a &lsquo;white area&rsquo; on the   Java ME map -- there are still many of them -- but to define an API that   covers such a white area without interfering with other, existing APIs.&rdquo;   For new ground, he suggests looking at Java SE since applications that   were once limited to desktop computers could now run on mobile devices,   except that the current Java SE APIs don't fit well, if at all. Non-Java   APIs, such as BREW or even Microsoft libraries, are also a source of   ideas for new JSRs. <br />
    <br />
    To make sure a JSR will fly with an overwhelmingly positive vote in the   EC, Ed advises submitters to make sure the JSR is &ldquo;novel&rdquo; and to give   compelling answers to questions 2.5, &ldquo;What need of the Java community   will be addressed by the proposed specification?&rdquo; and 2.6 &ldquo;Why isn't   this need met by existing specifications?&rdquo; It has also become necessary   to have an unofficial champion who is well regarded by the JCP program   and the Java development community and who will speak up in favor of the   submission and the submitter&rsquo;s Spec Leadership skills and   qualifications. Antti recommends contacting EC members even before   filing the proposal to solicit initial feedback and get any opposing   views to agree before the vote. Volker says it&rsquo;s &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; to compile   a diverse list of companies representing various business areas --   device manufacturers, software providers, and operators, for example --   to support the JSR. <br />
    <br />
    <div class=header3><strong>*Third, Recruit Experts/Observers*</strong> </div>
    <br /><br />
    While Spec Leads are important in developing Specifications, an Expert   Group won&rsquo;t get far without Experts to hash out the technology. In his   early days, David recruited people he knew personally in the industry.   He has decided it would&rsquo;ve been better to have recruited more companies   that were already active in the JCP program &ldquo;since they have the mindset to participate and have already filed all the paperwork with the   JCP PMO.&rdquo; <br />
    <br />
    Volker finds that when a few &ldquo;celebrity companies&rdquo; recruited from the   JSR&rsquo;s list of supporters are brought on board, interest in the Expert   Group rises quickly. <br />
    <br />
    Because JSRs spring from a need to standardize existing technology, Ed   likes to have stakeholders participate as Experts. He also feels that it   helps to have at least one Expert who is technically familiar with the   content, but whose forte is building consensus. <br />
    <br />
    David prefers a technical, developer-oriented Expert Group, which he has   found will generate more factual discussions and drive consensus more   easily. He says, &ldquo;Basically, I have almost a requirement that someone   who is actively involved in the Expert Group understands Java technology   from a developer&rsquo;s perspective.&rdquo; <br />
    <br />
    Antti agrees. Having better developer insights can lead to more   user-friendly design decisions, he says. <br />
    <br /><br />
    <div class=header3><strong>*Fourth, Launch the Expert Group as a Team*</strong> </div>

      If at all possible, kick off the Expert Group with a face-to-face   meeting of at least two days, Volker recommends. Informal get togethers   with the Expert Group are necessary, Volker says. As an Expert in   someone else&rsquo;s group, he &ldquo;had the experience once that the most   important decisions during an F2F were taken at night in the pub. Most   of the conversation afterwards was handled via phone calls and email   lists. It makes life much easier to have a face in mind,&rdquo; Volker says.   For geographically diverse groups, he suggests trading off where   additional face-to-face meetings will take place over the course of the   JSR effort. <br />
      <br />
    An initial phone conference can also work as a kick-off, David says, if   the geographical distribution, size, and working model of the Expert   Group prevents a quorum of Experts from being able to participate in a   face-to-face meeting. <br />
    <br />
    Experts who miss the initial launch activity and join later can have   difficulty grasping the working model and recognizing individuals in the   Expert Group. David has found that a &quot;Welcome to the Expert Group &amp;   Initial Directions&quot; FAQ was useful to bring them up to speed.<br />
