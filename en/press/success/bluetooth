 <B>JSR 82 Timeline</b><P>
 From start to finish, JSR 82 took nearly one and a half years. The 
Executive Committee approved its proposal October 2000. The 
original 14-member expert group took shape the next month, and seven 
additional members were added in July 2001 after the spec lead's talk 
at the JavaOne<sup><font size="-2">SM</font></sup> Conference. The community reviewed the spec in 
November, with public review following in December, and the final 
draft was proposed in January. On March 4, 2002, the final 
specification was approved by the Executive Committee.

By 2004, consumers won't need to carry quarters to purchase a coke 
from a vending machine. They won't need to hail the waitress for a 
check. They won't need plastic to pay for groceries. The common means 
of payment for purchases large and small will change for those who 
own a Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> technology-enabled Bluetooth<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> handheld device such as a 
mobile phone, pager, or PDA. So predicts C Bala Kumar, Distinguished 
Member of Technical Staff for Motorola's Wireless Software, 
Application and Services group, and the specification lead for JSR 82 in
the Java Community Process<sup><font size="-2">SM</font></sup> (JCP) Program.
<P>
Behind such a prediction lies the 10th century story of a certain 
King Harald Bluetooth, a Viking who united Denmark and Norway and 
professed the new Christian religion. Taking a page from history, the 
Bluetooth standard introduced in 1998 unites the two industrial 
kingdoms of telecommunications and computing, replacing infrared 
connectivity with the Bluetooth short-range (10-100 m) radio link.
<P>
But Bluetooth has a cavity, a painful hole visible to implementers, 
developers, and consumers. To enable constant universal connectivity, 
a Bluetooth stack, radio, and applications must be installed on 
myriad devices, each of which represents proprietary hardware and a 
specific operating system. Implementers such as Motorola, Nokia, and 
Ericsson understand that the Bluetooth-enabled phones they offer 
won't entice hoards of consumers if few applications are available 
for them. However, a Bluetooth programmer can't be bothered to create 
even a simple multi-user tic-tac-toe game if it's necessary to 
rewrite the application for each unique device.
<P>
JSR 82: Java APIs for Bluetooth lays a clean foundation for Bluetooth 
hardware implementers, makes development easy for application 
writers, and ultimately fuels the interest in devices that consumers 
simply must have.

<P>
In driving JSR 82 through the JCP Program, spec lead Kumar adhered to
three principles. First, he actively recruited diverse experts related
not just to Java technology but to Bluetooth hardware and software. The
original 14 members included Brad Threatt, Ericsson, Extended Systems,
IBM, Mitsubishi Electric Corp., Motorola, Nokia Corp., Parthus 
Technologies PLC, Research In Motion LTD, Rococo Software, Sun 
Microsystems, Symbian LTD, Vaultus, and Zucotto Wireless. Midway 
through the project, seven more organizations clamored to be admitted 
into the expert group. While most expert groups typically refuse to 
admit this many new experts so far along in the project, Kumar and 
his fellow experts felt strongly that on a project of this scope it 
was imperative to solicit the widest possible range of input. So 
membership swelled to 21.
<P>
With these additional voices came suggestions for revisions to the 
work already accomplished. Again, many groups might refuse such 
retrofitting, but Kumar and his colleagues agreed with a second 
principle, to have no sacred cows; they were willing to make radical 
revisions whenever the need for them became apparent. Even after 
public review, Kumar made major changes to JSR 82 in order to address 
new ideas. The experts had to review each change, but they were 
willing to do so when the effort yielded a more robust and elegant 
specification. Even those outside the expert group praised the late 
changes, emailing kudos to Kumar: "The API is looking very good -- 
easily the best Bluetooth API I've seen in any language." and ". . 
.the JSR-82 is well structured and good to understand."
<P>
Kumar began each meeting with a restatement of his third principle 
that members be permitted to disagree but commit. On numerous 
occasions an expert would state an opinion clearly not shared by the 
group, then voluntarily add, "I think this is the time when I'll have 
to disagree but commit." And the conversation would continue 
productively building toward consensus.
<P>
The specification targeted Java 2 Micro Edition<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> (J2ME<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup>) high-volume 
mobile devices for several reasons. First of all, building on the 
Java language permits Bluetooth application developers to write once 
and run over any J2ME enabled Bluetooth radio-equipped handhelds. 
Moreover, it's important to address the area of greatest demand 
first, and low-end J2ME devices will probably be the first Bluetooth 
devices to sell in high volume to consumers. It's also efficient to 
pave the way for future products. J2ME devices represent a technical 
challenge, with their small footprint and limited memory, so whatever 
works under these constraints can be adapted later fairly easily to 
work with Java 2 Standard Edition<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> (J2SE<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup>) computing devices such as 
laptops.
<P>
To aid in the implementation (and ultimate J2SE adaptation) of the 
spec, JSR 82 fit the Generic Connection Framework (GCF), which is 
part of the Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDC). 
Organizations that build J2ME phones are already familiar with this 
framework, and the Java APIs for Bluetooth are just an extension of 
that. If a group employs the same Bluetooth stack used in the 
Reference Implementation (RI) created by Motorola, they can simply 
license it, run the Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK), and achieve 
compliance. However, there are many Bluetooth stacks available, so 
those who employ alternative solutions can use the RI as an example, 
then build their own.
<P>
The team was concerned more about making the process easier for 
developers than for implementers. They knew the implementers wouldn't 
mind adding complex Bluetooth capability into the phone as long as 
developers were able to create the games and applications that would 
become the phone's selling point. Kumar says, "In writing the API, 
some individual members would stray from our goal of simplicity, but 
during cross-checking others would challenge them about being too 
complicated. To keep focused, we would think of a guy writing a 
simple tic-tac-toe program to be played over Bluetooth between two 
phones."
<P>
"It's tricky to fit Bluetooth, an immature technology that is still 
growing and changing, into the more mature, well-defined Java 
technology. The need for this API has not changed at all since we 
started. In fact, there is even more demand," says Kumar. In fact, 
over thirty percent of the handsets sold in 2003 are likely to be 
Java technology-enabled, and many are expected to have Bluetooth 
capability. As soon as the spec was made available for public review, 
at least two companies outside of the expert group began building 
product based on it. Later in 2002, three expert group members are 
expected to launch their implementations.
<P>
