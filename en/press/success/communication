<p></font>When it comes to leading 
              the JSR 16, Connector Architecture, expert group, Rahul Sharma of 
              Sun Microsystems holds a unique perspective: he considers the experts 
              his customers. Rahul works full-time as specification lead, filing 
              JSRs, offering strawman proposals, eliciting feedback, teasing out 
              common ground, and driving home consensus. He does all this to get 
              approval from his customers, the experts. They, in turn, want to 
              satisfy their customers -- the companies and developers they represent. 
              Those entities, then, live to delight end customers, who demand 
              the most. The customer, no doubt, is always right. At least, when 
              participants fully engage in the Java Community Process<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">SM</FONT></SUP> 
              (JCP) program, it seems to work out that way.</font></p>

              16 was approved May 1999, but in June the process began firing on 
              all cylinders when the CAFE closed, Rahul became spec lead, and 
              he recruited fifteen experts. Because JSR 16 was one of the first 
              in the Java&#153; 2 Platform Enterprise Edition (J2EE&#153;) space 
              when J2EE technology had yet to prove itself, recruiting experts 
              should have been difficult. And it would have been if Rahul had 
              not relied on one of the tools he values most: <i>communication</i>.</font></p>

	         <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rahul also believes that 
              having an initial strawman helped him clearly articulate the requirements 
              of the project in terms of concrete issues and use cases. People 
              were more willing to sign on once they understood the goals and 
              scope of JSR 16: to solve the problem of integrating compelling 
              Java applications with existing and legacy enterprise applications 
              and systems. Then the hard work began in earnest.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Face-to-Face Group 
              Meetings<br>
              </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During eleven 
              months of intensive work on the specification, the JSR 16 experts 
              met together twice, face-to-face. A detailed agenda -- communicated 
              beforehand -- contributed to the success of the kick-off meeting. 
              Everyone was expected to be prepared to engage Rahul's strawman 
              on the issues.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rahul believed it important 
              to start out in a face-to-face situation, but he felt surprised 
              and gratified when all members showed up for the two-day event in 
              August 1999, at his building in Cupertino, California. Because Rahul 
              held the meeting at his own location, it was easy for him to invite 
              his director and others who worked on related specifications to 
              share relevant information with his own team.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Without assuming the 
              experts had prior knowledge, Rahul gave background on each issue. 
              Then experts identified important design issues and provided useful 
              technical inputs. Rahul took meeting minutes detailing the opinions 
              expressed. For each issue, Rahul felt it was important to assign 
              time-bound action items immediately to prevent issues from getting 
              ignored. Rahul identified what action would be taken, who would 
              take it, by when, and for which version of JSR 16.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A few months later when 
              the specification had stabilized, a second all-hands meeting took 
              place. Rahul says the goal was &quot;to drive the resolution of 
              each issue listed in the first meeting to a consensus, define the 
              features for the next version, and address requirements from each 
              expert to his or her satisfaction.&quot; But consensus was possible 
              only because Rahul listened to individuals.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the all-hands meetings, 
              experts listened intently to presentations, but when asked to offer 
              feedback in front of others, many would pass. JSR 16 expert Jon 
              Dart, of TIBCO Software Inc., says, &quot;I'm usually willing to 
              share comments on the spec and suggestions for improvements with 
              the group. Of course, I can't discuss any part of TIBCO technology 
              that involves trade secrets. I also can't discuss product plans 
              or unannounced products. And I'm reluctant to give details of some 
              technology areas in which we have a competitive advantage. But generally 
              I don't think these constraints greatly interfered with my participation 
              in the expert group.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rahul understands the 
              ambivalence of experts who may not want to share company-specific 
              information with other experts, but just with the spec lead. &quot;It's 
              the responsibility of the spec lead to resolve issue on their technical 
              merit and not be constrained by political or company-specific compulsions. 
              It's very tricky,&quot; says Rahul.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rahul's solution was 
              to draw out individual experts in one-on-ones, during which the 
              experts had plenty of ideas to offer. For experts in Australia and 
              Japan, Rahul set up long conference calls, during which they went 
              through every issue.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Experts were satisfied 
              to have had the spec lead's ear, knowing that it is the responsibility 
              of a spec lead to ensure that intellectual property specific to 
              a participating company is never revealed to another expert or expert 
              group. Rahul felt the individual exchanges were more efficient and 
              a better means of consensus-building than group-wide email discussions. 
              Nevertheless, email had its own place in his communication strategy.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Email Lists<br>
              </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Everyday communication 
              took place primarily through two mailing lists. Opinions and announcements 
              were shared with all experts through a group-wide alias. Another 
              alias sent issues to the spec lead only.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In any email list, maybe 
              a quarter of the participants contribute enthusiastically and persistently 
              to brainstorming sessions and fine-grained discussions. Others may 
              reply to an issue only initially, contribute sporadically, or merely 
              lurk. The challenge lies with those who don't interact. Rahul wonders, 
              &quot;Does a no-reply mean they're satisfied with an issue or don't 
              have time to respond?&quot; No-replies make it practically impossible 
              to drive an email discussion to final consensus.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Clearly, email alone 
              is insufficient. As Rahul puts it, &quot;A lot of expert groups 
              assume that setting up email for communication solves the whole 
              thing. But the key is to make an expert group into an effective 
              team through effective communication, good interpersonal relationships, 
              and face-to-face meetings.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Communication Pays 
              Off<br>
              </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After considerable 
              teamwork in talking, emailing, conference calling, keyboarding, 
              and consulting the Program Management Office (PMO), the expert group 
              delivered a quality specification that addressed the original scope 
              and requirements. Each expert brought value to the team in terms 
              of technical input and contributions, while the spec lead drove 
              the schedule milestones and promoted communication among the experts.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The participant review 
              closed in May 2000, with public review closing two months later. 
              By October, a final draft was proposed, and it was all over but 
              the shouting, that is, the shouting of thanks by the multiple companies 
              who adopted it.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Generally pleased with 
              the entire process, Jon Dart says, &quot;Feedback and discussion 
              within the expert group led to a better design. And I prefer having 
              a structured process. It gives both expert group participants and 
              the larger Java community clear milestones and expectations.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">JSR 16 expert Pavan Bhatnagar 
              of iPlanet (TM) E-commerce Solutions was likewise satisfied with 
              his involvement in the JCP. Like other involved companies, iPlanet 
              benefits from having an expert in the group. &quot;We get a jump 
              start over everybody else who might go after the standard at some 
              point in time. Speed to market is very important,&quot; says Pavan.</font></p>
