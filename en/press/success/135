Jack and Jane Jones don't know it yet, but they are going to want to
upgrade their cellular phones. The term "multimedia" may not excite
the Joneses, but the ability to record and play back audio, video,
and still images of their kids certainly will. Every time they see
their child flash a cheesy grin, crack a silly joke, or show off
their gymnastic prowess, they're going to want to grab a device to
record it for posterity. Soon, phones and other Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup>
technology-enabled mobile devices -- PDAs, handhelds, organizers, and
so forth -- will let them digitize meaningful events on the go and
upload them to friends and relatives.
<P>
<B>Industry Awaits Multimedia Support</B>
<P>

In the meantime, while the Joneses may be still unaware of these
future products, the Java 2 Micro Edition<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> (J2ME<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup>) industry is all
too focused on what is coming. Throughout 2002, the industry has
signaled its interest in enhancing mobile devices with Java
technology by widely adopting the Mobile Information Device Profile
(MIDP) for the J2ME Platform. As increasing numbers of mobile devices
are equipped with Java technology, the lack of multimedia support for
such devices in current Java Community Process<sup><font size="-2">SM</font></sup> (JCP<sup><font size="-2">SM</font></sup>) program standards
became more obvious.

Jyri Huopaniemi of Nokia acknowledges the "clear and rapid need" for
multimedia support in MIDP and Connected Limited Device Configuration
(CLDC) environments as the main driver for JSR 135 Mobile Media API.
"The industry anticipated availability for this optional J2ME package.
There's competition in the market and some other technologies may be offering
similar features, so these added pressure to get the specification out in a timely
manner," says Huopaniemi, spec lead for JSR 135.
<P>
<B>Global Expert Team for Global Interests</B>
<P>

From the outset, the specification was designed to satisfy the global
interests of device manufacturers, content creators, wireless service
providers, and end users. The original JSR 135 proposal was endorsed
by Nokia, Sun Microsystems, and Beatnik, with Finland-based Nokia
appointed spec lead. To form the expert group, about 16 companies
were selected from nominations submitted to the JCP Program
Management Office (PMO), and four additional experts were added later
with the consent of the group.
<P>
"We tried to assemble as widely varied an expert group as possible,"
says Huopaniemi. Members represented a diversity in three important
dimensions: technical understanding, business acumen, and cultural
awareness. Multimedia developers had audio, music, and video
expertise, and the associated platform knowledge. Terminal
manufacturers and wireless service providers provided insights into
business and deployment issues. Experts from Europe, North America,
and Asia represented those regional markets, where someday
enthusiastic customers are expected to purchase multimedia-capable
mobile devices and the color-rich multimedia applications that
exploit the various implementations of the new Java specification.
<P>
<B>Realistic Schedule Balances Speed with Quality</B>
<P>
Interest and excitement has been building for this technology. The
JCP has responded to industry demand by balancing the need to produce
and deliver an effective specification with the need for speed to
market. Huopaniemi appreciates the rigor of the overall JCP program.
"The overall process where you go to community, public, and final
draft, and then have the review period sets a good framework for
progressing with the specification," he says. Nevertheless, it can be
hard to make progress as rapidly as the industry would like to see
it, so the trick is to balance the need to make technology available quickly
with the JCP's interest in quality. "Of course we want to provide the
best specification possible, so we need to have time in order to
solve all of the technical issues. It's a tradeoff between time and
refinement," says Huopaniemi.

interoperable mobile multimedia applications, and it plays an
important role in bringing new rich media features to entertainment

The spec lead walks the fine line of both guarding time for experts
to address solutions and of maintaining overall progress toward final
approval. According to Huopaniemi, "Spec leads take into account the
arguments and ideas of the experts and really try to get the best
solution, but then they are expected to drive decision-making so
things get done according to a schedule." Huopaniemi feels it's
important to envision a realistic schedule from the start rather than
one that is overly optimistic or pessimistic. He says, "It's good to
let the Expert Group (EG) and interested parties know the specification is
going to be done in a certain time."
<P>
To push JSR 135 along, Huopaniemi set an aggressive one-year schedule
and met the challenge of adhering to it while he guided the
specification along the normal JCP path. Although May 2001 was the
official start date of JSR 135, the expert group formation and work
didn't actually begin until July, and it concluded June 2002.
<P>
From Canada, Tim Rahrer, director of technology for Zucotto Wireless
and JSR 135 expert, admired Huopaniemi's equitable handling of
requests for features as well as his ability to balance the demands
regarding functionality, footprint, and time to completion. "JSR 135
was a great example of a well-organized and well-run JSR. The scope
was kept well-bounded to ensure we could turn the spec around
quickly," says Rahrer, who also serves on the JCP Executive Committee.
JCP expert groups don't often interact among each other, but Rahrer
was pleased with the level of cooperation and interaction between the
JSR 135 and JSR 118 MIDP 2 Expert Groups (EGs). He says, "Acknowledging
the expertise in JSR 135, the MIDP EG looked to us to establish a
minimum subset of JSR 135 to be included in the next version of the
MID Profile. The two groups cooperated on defining the feature set and
ensured that MIDP 2 has vastly improved support for media features and that device
manufacturers have a smooth path to upgrade to enhanced media
features by adding JSR 135 APIs."

            <p>

The expert group has brought the project to its conclusion, with
final approval given June 24, 2002. Huopaniemi is proud of his expert
group's work on JSR 135. "The specification changed quite a bit from
the original submission, and the EG has done an excellent job
bringing this API to a successful finishing stage," he says.
<P>
With the API now available, the international market can offer
multimedia support for customers who own or will acquire Java
technology-capable mobile devices.
<P>
In early September 2002, Nokia announced the first mobile phone in the
market to support the JSR-135 Mobile Media API, the Nokia 3650
(<a href="http://www.nokia.com/phones/3650">http://www.nokia.com/phones/3650</a>). This phone features audio, MIDI,
video and camera support for Java MIDP through the Mobile Media API, and
enables the creation of compelling Java multimedia applications.
<P>
Zucotto Wireless considers JSR 135 a key technology for their
customers, who are leading handset and wireless device chip
manufacturers. "Media capabilities are becoming an increasingly
important feature of wireless devices," says Rahrer, noting the
popularity of the "sha-mail" photo email service and camera-phones on
the J-phone network in Japan. "Java technology is a great way to access and
control media features on these devices, and our Java hardware
processor is uniquely able to run compelling, media-rich Java content
well."
<P>
Until JSR 135 became available, Zucotto Wireless had to create
proprietary interfaces to media features in their products. "We were
pleased to participate in the JSR 135 expert group to help create
industry standard mobile media APIs, which will help further the
wireless Java content industry by enabling interoperable media-rich

Ultimately, Zucotto Wireless plans to convert their proprietary media
interfaces to full JSR 135 support, as customer demand calls for it.
But for now they'll support the subset of JSR 135 that was adopted by
MIDP 2.0. Rahrer says, "Zucotto Wireless offers Java hardware engines
that enable feature-rich, revenue generating applications on mobile
devices. Our hardware processor cores execute Java bytecodes directly
in hardware and we provide a software layer and full API support for
either MIDP or DoJa profiles." Products with MIDP 2.0 and JSR 135
support are scheduled for release along with customer handset product
rollouts in 2003.

The welcome changes JSR 135 enables are being implemented by
manufacturers, developers, and carriers. "The mobile industry is
undergoing a major change from voice-only communications to a
combination of voice, data, and multimedia in mobile applications.
The JSR 135 Mobile Media API is a first true enabler for
interoperable mobile multimedia applications, and it plays an
important role in bringing new rich media features to entertainment
and business applications," says Huopaniemi.

The Joneses in North America will soon be snapping pictures and
creating movies of their grandkids to upload to friends and relatives
over an increasingly busy network. At the same time, the Rousseaus in
France may be downloading a movie or live news broadcast to view or
record on their mobile screen, while the Tan children in Singapore
play a full-featured game on their mom's Java technology-capable PDA.  JCP-incubated
technology ripples around the world.
