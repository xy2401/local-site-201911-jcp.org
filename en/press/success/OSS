One by one, representatives of prominent telecommunications companies
came knocking on Philippe Lalande's door at Sun Microsystems. They
all wanted the same thing: interchangeable, interoperable,
off-the-shelf business components for quick assembly into Operations
Support System (OSS) solutions. These solutions would be for service
activation, quality of service, billing, trouble ticketing, and other
key areas. To get there, and to move away from the pain of the
current fragmented and proprietary OSS market, they longed for the
widespread adoption of an open, standards-based, market that would be 
able to address their need for carrier-grade OSS solutions.
<P>
For years, these representatives discussed these issues while serving
on various standards bodies. So what they told Lalande was not new,
but increasingly urgent. The economy was slowing down at the same
time that demand for communication services was skyrocketing. Yet
nearly half of the $50 billion spent in the OSS market was for
custom-made solutions that were painful, hardly reusable, and 
expensive to maintain year after year.
<P>
By October 2000, fifteen companies that belonged to the Java 
Community Process<sup><font size="-2">SM</font></sup> (JCP<sup><font size="-2">SM</font></sup>) program formally agreed to participate in what is
now called the OSS through Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> (OSS/J) Initiative. The original 
core OSS/J companies were Sun, Cisco, Ericsson, Motorola, NEC, Nokia,
Nortel, and Telcordia. With Lalande as program manager, the OSS/J
Initiative used the JCP program to bring technologies based on Java 2
Platform, Enterprise Edition<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> (J2EE<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup>) to the OSS market. Lalande
explains, "We chose J2EE as the underlying platform to use mainstream
enterprise technology, in order to share the investment with other 
industries. We focused on functional OSS APIs, and chose the JCP to
produce developer friendly APIs, to foster a market of certifiable 
OSS components, and to seamlessly extend the capabilities of the Java
platform."
<P>

<B>The OSS/J Initiative Begins</B>
<P>
The fledgling OSS/J Initiative recognized the need for an ongoing
technical advisory committee to promote the vision and goals of the
group. Led by Pierre Gauthier of MetaSolv, the Architecture Board 
comprises representatives of the core companies. Responsibilities
included determining how to structure OSS Application Programming
Interfaces (APIs), advising OSS expert groups, and deciding which OSS
areas to address next. To encourage the implementation of
JCP-approved OSS specifications, OSS/J member companies create
relevant tools and hold informational seminars and demonstrations of
OSS/J technology.
<P>
Early on, the Architecture Board recognized the need to base OSS/J
technologies on common architecture guidelines and JCP standards. "We
complement the JCP program," Gauthier said. "The mission of the
Architecture Board is to turn the OSS/J vision into concrete
solutions that meet the OSS market requirements and the general
software industry trends and patterns and to speed up the development
of specifications and reference implementations."
<P>
For multiple Java Specification Requests (JSRs) that relate to a
common vertical market, it is extremely important to overall
productivity and efficiency to maintain consistency from one
specification to the next. A developer who learns the concepts in one
API can more easily understand and implement related APIs. To ensure
that such consistency was built into all OSS/J JSRs, the Architecture
Board produced the OSS/J Design Guidelines, a set of
industry-accepted design patterns and component definitions that
OSS/J spec leads follow. Under these guidelines, specifications and
reference implementations are easier to create and better in quality.
<P>
Architects from OSS/J member companies -- plus Spec Leads for the
first three OSS/J APIs -- formed an Expert Group to create JSR 144
OSS Common API, led by Daniel Lutoff of Sun. To provide consistency
and reduce duplication of common interfaces and classes among the
OSS/J specifications, the Expert Group extracted what was common
among the three APIs to create the first technical umbrella JSR. The
resulting specification includes the OSS/J Design Guidelines.

                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
<P>

Every OSS/J JSR is an implementation of "The Common API." "Each time
a new OSS/J JSR is started, it reuses the results of the common work
done by the OSS/J Initiative, now standardized as JSR 144," says
Lutoff. Using this template as a foundation, Expert Groups can worry
more about technical issues and less about how to format the content.
<P>
Lutoff believes these programmatic rules and standardized classes are
useful for any JSR that sits on top of J2EE technology. Rick Porter,
the JSR 90 Maintenance Lead, reports that JSR 144 is also used
internally by companies. He says, "When we at Telcordia are designing
an interface to one of our systems, we've looked at this as a good
way to make our interfaces open."
<P>

<B>Standard Components Needed for Service Activation</b>
<P>
Although an entire spectrum of APIs is needed, the Architecture Board
first addressed those defined as crucial by the telecommunications
industry. For an industry straightjacketed by proprietary solutions,
OSS/J APIs were developed to enable the assembly of commercial
off-the-shelf-components, resulting in end-to-end OSS solutions for
key functions like provisioning, billing, and so forth. Those
end-to-end solutions have proved elusive until now and deliver huge
value to service providers.
<P>
When JSR 89 OSS Service Activation API was submitted, no standard
components existed for the service activation area of OSS. Each
available product addressed only a tiny aspect of all the processes
that had to be handled. These components could be purchased from many
sources, but they were are not interoperable. For a complete
solution, customers had to write specific code to integrate the
different components, a tedious, costly, and non-reusable venture.
<P>
Spec Lead Stefan Vaillant of Nokia expected JSR 89 to reduce
integration efforts by creating a set of standards that would enable
the creation of a reusable software component market. Maintenance
Lead Andreas Ebbert of Nokia says, "The products we expect to show up
are components that don't differentiate in terms of the proprietary
interfaces but in terms of the functionality and quality they offer."
Then users can select components that match their needs best and plug
them together with minimal effort or cost.
<P>
<table width="110" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" align

                  </table>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
<P>

In the environment that OSS/J technology is making possible,
companies can develop new products. Ebbert notes, "It's a
pre-competitive environment because there has been no OSS component
market until now.  That's what the excitement is about -- to develop
interfaces that enable a whole new market." IP VALUE, a startup in
Germany, looked for a business opportunity and found OSS/J technology
too compelling to ignore. At present, IP VALUE's sole product is an
OSS/J-certified implementation of JSR 89 that enables flow-through,
zero-touch service provisioning for overcoming bottlenecks caused by
inefficient manual processes.
<P>
This implementation is part of IP VALUE's Service Creation Factory
product suite, which enables service providers to deliver enhanced,
value-added services quickly, easily, and efficiently by automating
and streamlining the service delivery processes. Chief architect
Thomas Schmal of IP VALUE says, "Using standardized APIs for
automating the service provisioning process reduces the integration
costs for our customers significantly." This is why OSS/J technology
is perceived by IP VALUE's customers -- regional service providers
as well as major mobile operators -- as a telecommunication market
focused, component-based enterprise application integration (EAI)
approach. Pilot installations at T-Systems, a division of Deutsche
Telekom Group, are used for demonstrating the flexibility and cost reduction 
capabilities of the Service Creation Factory.
<P>
In another certified implementation of JSR 89, Intracom offers a
Java-based transactional service activator, which allows an engine to
roll back to an earlier step when a step fails during a multi-step
activation, thereby preventing underlying network resources from
crashing. The Mobile Workforce Management OSS/J Solution by IBM
Business Consulting Services is a third product implementation of JSR
89.
<P>
MetaSolv has two JSR 89-based pre-products in the works. One is an
Automated Service Activation Program (ASAP) to communicate with
multiple heterogeneous network technologies across diverse technology
domains, and the other is an Order Management System (OMS) to offer
precise control over service provisioning. Nokia and Digital Fairway
are also developing pre-products based on this API.
<P>

<B>Quality of Service API Piques Interest</b>
<P>
Some OSS/J equipment vendors as well as Telcordia, one of the largest
OSS providers, saw a critical need for a Quality of Service API.
"Telcordia builds OSSs, which would be clients of the API. The
Quality of Service API allows us to build an adapter that will talk
to any Element Management System (EMS) that implements the API, so it
makes integration a lot easier for service providers," says
Telcordia's Rick Porter. Porter is Maintenance Lead for JSR 90 OSS
Quality of Service API, which, under the original Spec Leadership of
Stefan Aberg of Ericsson, addressed performance measurement,
performance thresholding, and fault monitoring.

JSR 90 went public November 2002, but 3rd Generation Partnership Project 
(3GPP), focusing on standards for the GSM, GPRS, UMTS markets, and 3GPP2, 
focusing on standards for the CDMA, cdma2000: 1X-RTT, EV/D0 and EV/DV markets,
have not yet completed final specifications of their Performance Management interface
standards. The Quality of Service team understands the importance of aligning with 3GPP's and 3GPP2's effort and is working towards alignment between the two specifications. 
Motorola is leading the alignment effort between OSS/J, 3GPP and 3GPP2 along with many
of the OSS/J companies. While some may be waiting to compare 3GPP's final specification
with the performance part of JSR 90, there is considerable interest in the API, as 
indicated by over six hundred downloads since November. Several OSS/J companies are already
using the specification internally, and Telcordia, Digital Fairway, and Nokia are now 
developing OSS/J-compliant software that could be productized.
<P>
Several products have already hit the market. Mycom International
offers a product, NIMS-PrOptima, based on its early adoption of the
API. NIMS-PrOptima is a scalable and carrier-grade Next Generation
Performance and Service Management platform, whose importation engine
interfaces with a variety of data sources. IBM Business Consulting
Services employs JSR 90 in its Mobile Workforce Management OSS/J
Solution to support network fault monitoring and Quality of
Service/Service Level Agreement management.
<P>
ILOG JTGO employs JSR 90 to offer the first complete suite of Java
graphic components for OSSs. Now considered a de facto standard, ILOG
JTGO was named Best Java Component in the Java Developer's Journal
Readers' Choice Awards for 2002. Winning this prestigious award "speaks volumes of the value ILOG JTGO \par
brings to the software development professionals who are bringing the
next-generation operations support systems to market," says Doug
Doyle, ILOG's vice president of marketing.

<B>Trouble Ticket Considered Essential Technology</B>
<P>
Trouble ticketing is considered an essential component of any OSS,
and for good reason. According to Spec Lead Pierre Gauthier of
MetaSolv, the JSR 91 OSS Trouble Ticket API offers at least three
substantial benefits to implementers.
<P>

First, a standard, open interface helps developers integrate many
types of information systems together. The API's flexible structure
makes it possible to do several things: call a trouble-ticket system
using the integration of a work-flow engine, have a customer-care
application send a trouble ticket to a service provider, have an
event management system automatically generate a trouble ticket, or
have a service provider generate a trouble ticket.
<P>
For companies that are beginning to use Enterprise JavaBeans<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup>
(EJB<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup>) and J2EE technologies, the Trouble Ticket API offers a second
benefit: a mechanism in which to wrap their trouble ticketing system.
As Gauthier puts it, "They can plug their own entity bean into this
infrastructure, and they get all the rest for free -- the XML
messaging and the session bean facade. This plug-in infrastructure
has been extremely useful for a number of companies."
<P>
Third, trouble tickets are a part of business-to-business
relationships. A number of companies have expressed appreciation for
the API's Extensible Markup Language (XML) interface, viewing the XML
part of the API as "one of the finest XML specifications they've seen
so far for that topic," says Gauthier.
<P>
The Trouble Ticket API had a number of early adopters, including 
NEC, Siemens, and Telegea, some of whom
either implemented the technology into their existing products or
modified it to fit their infrastructure. To encourage the adoption of
JSR 91 by other companies, ILOG developed a module that can generate
OSS/J-compliant trouble tickets. Digital Fairway has a pre-product,
eOSS Product Suite, that is not yet generally available. Herschel
Technologies' pre-product, Herschel Integration Suite, can integrate
any CORBA-based Network Management system with trouble ticketing
systems based on the API. IBM Business Consulting Services has used
the specification to provide for trouble ticket resolution in its
Mobile Workforce Management OSS/J Solution, a commercial product.

<B>Generic Transport Mechanism for IP Billing</B>
<P>
New data services are constantly being defined, but until recently no
standard API existed for integrating the collection of usage data for
these services into a service provider's billing environment, says
James Jouett of NEC, Spec Lead for JSR 130 OSS IP Billing API. Now
that JSR 130 provides a generic transport mechanism that all the 
different devices can use to communicate with the billing system, 
various parties stand to benefit.

                  </table>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
<P>

For example, if a provider decides to offer a new service, they 
nearly always need to manually code in the transport capability for 
sending usage data from the new server to the billing system. But by
implementing the API, it's an off-the-shelf job, not a custom one.
This specification allows a billing system to easily integrate any
number of usage data sources, supporting the convergence of IP and
traditional services. Since the API allows the transfer of data in
any format, regardless of the content, it can be applied to any 
technology or service that provides usage data for billing purposes.
<P>
Even though the spec has only recently gone to Final Release, as of
January the API had been downloaded over one thousand times,
indicating strong interest in the community. NEC is currently working
to implement the API for some of their network management and
mediation products, which should be available this year.
<P>

<B>Development and Implementation Continues</B>
<P>
The implementation process has only begun. "In an economic environment where CSPs are under increasing pressure to
decrease operating costs and leverage existing software investments,
standards initiatives such as OSS through Java are a means to help CSPs
achieve these end goals", says Sharon Ballard, Analyst, The Yankee Group.
<P>
Nokia, a leading OSS vendor, has announced plans for adopting the
OSS/J APIs into a forthcoming release of the Nokia NetAct OSS, a
future-proof, scalable framework for operating an entire managed
network. JSR 142 OSS Inventory API led by Vassil Rachkov of MetaSolv
is in Public Review, and Digital Fairway's eOSS Product Suite is
implementing an early adoption version of the specification.
<P>
Overall, the OSS/J specifications have proven to work well, as borne 
out by numerous case studies conducted by BEA Systems, BTexact, ILOG,
Lumos, Mahindra British Telecom, MetaSolv, Motorola, Oracle, Sonic
Software, Sun, and other companies. In some ways, OSS/J API
development and implementation work is just starting. The
Architecture Board is discussing which JSRs will be developed next to
address whether and how to use EJB technology, XML technology and Web
Services.
<P>
According to IDC analyst, Elisabeth Rainge, "As a result of the OSS through Java efforts, OSS and billing
architectures are evolving, competitive dynamics in OSS and billing
are shifting, and usage of Java technologies in the industry
community is showing that this initiative can have a deep and 
far-reaching effect on the industry".
