The Java Community Process (JCP) program relies on the work of Spec Leads and Maintenance Leads to continue the standardization of Java Platform Micro Edition (Java ME), Standard Edition (Java SE), Enterprise Edition (Java EE), and other Java technologies and processes. These leaders communicate with their Expert Group, the Program Management Office (PMO), the Executive Committee (EC), and the public using their JSRs' home page, community web pages, observer aliases, blogs, tweets, and other tools. They track the milestones that keep their Java Specification Requests (JSRs), Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), Reference Implementations (RIs), and Technology Compatibility Kits (TCKs) progressing on schedule. The JCP program recognizes and appreciates all active Spec Leads and Maintenance Leads. You can also read <a href="./previous_sl">Previous Specification Lead Profiles</a>.<P>
In preparing these profiles, the PMO also asked Specification Leads to tell about their experiences as Spec Leads. This led to the related article<br>

After writing his master's thesis for the CERN LHC particle collider, Jean-Yves Bitterlich achieved an MS degree in Computer Science from Oxford University to go with his engineering diploma from the Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Informatique pour l'Industrie et l'Entreprise (ENS-IIE). After a stint as scientific military engineer, he worked for various research and innovation labs (Europe Online, DGA/SPOTI, Cap Gemini, Alcatel Mobile Phones, Siemens Mobile/BenQ Mobile) and co-founded a number of internet companies in Europe. For most of his career, he has focused on electronic payment systems, internet applications, and telecommunications. He holds sixteen European patents. While at Siemens Mobile, the business value of running Java on mobiles became obvious. After assessing what contributions could be made to grow the ecosystem, Jean-Yves started right away as specification leader overseeing the design of Siemens' proprietary solution. 
<P>

Jean-Yves became Senior Staff Engineer for Sun Microsystems in 2007, and after Oracle acquired Sun, he became Technology Manager. As part of his Sun/Oracle responsibilities, Jean-Yves served actively in the W3C WebAPI WG, the OMTP, and the WAC forum, as well as the JCP program, a role he started much earlier, in 2003. During that year he submitted <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=229">JSR 229</a>, Payment API, which achieved final release just two years later. By 2006, Jean-Yves had become BenQ's Spec Lead for <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=259">JSR 259</a>, Ad Hoc Networking API, which was nominated for the JCP program's <i>Most Innovative JSR for Java ME</i> award. Two years after that, Jean-Yves himself was nominated <i>Most Outstanding Java ME Spec Lead</i> for his leadership of <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=280">JSR 280</a>, XML API for Java ME, and <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=290">JSR 290</a>, Java Language & XML User Interface Markup Integration. JSR 290, which Jean-Yves considers his most challenging specification, was awarded <i>Most Innovative JSR for Java ME</i> in 2008. 
<P>

Lately his responsibilities have extended towards the Java Card platform evolution, as well as the intersection of embedded and trusted platforms with very small and secure technologies. He speaks regularly at events such as JavaOne and the Mobile World Congress. When he needs to revitalize, he hits the golf course, fixes up his garden, and spends time with his family, which includes two daughters. His family moved recently to France, but his idea of home is a little more fluid: "anywhere where there are people to talk to, as well as internet connectivity and an airport."

Pavel Bucek is a Principal Software Engineer at Oracle in Czech Republic, Prague. He first got involved with 
Java technology and with the Java Community Process (JCP) program right after he graduated with a Masters degree 
from Czech Technical University, and a major in Computer Networks and Internet. He was hired as Software Engineer 
to Sun Microsystems and contributed to JAXB, then to Jersey and after that Tyrus. As a developer of the reference 
implementations for these specifications,  he sometimes worked on various proof of concepts of features which 
became part of the specification. He made significant contributions WebSocket and Tyrus, working on specification 
and implementation in parallel. Pavel is currently a co-spec lead of JAX-RS 2.1 (JSR 370) and maintenance lead of 
the WebSocket Specification (JSR 356).  Pavel is interested in web services - REST & WebSocket, and how these 
technologies can be used in distributed environments.  When he is not working, Pavel enjoys driving his (motor) 
bike, hiking and computer games when the weather is not suitable for outdoor activities.  You can find out more

Playing <a href="http://ridingthecrest.com/edburns/classic-gaming/tunnels/">Tunnels of Doom</a> on a TI-99/4A computer in 1982 turned Ed Burns into a programmer. By 1995 he'd earned a bachelor's in Computer Science, with a minor in Germanic Studies and emphasis on computer music, through University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Through UIUC's co-op program, Ed worked for IBM and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). These experiences, plus programming in Objective-C on the NeXT computers in the computer music lab, propelled Ed into the dot-com boom. After a brief stint at Silicon Graphics, he landed at Sun Microsystems, which was acquired by Oracle in 2009.<P>

Ed is currently a Consulting Member of the Technical Staff at Oracle, telecommuting from his home is Altamonte Springs, Florida, where he is married with two sons. He is responsible for leading specifications within the JCP program, serving as co-Spec Lead of the three successive versions of Java ServerFaces (JSF) developed through JSRs <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=127">127</a>, <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=252">252</a>, and <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=314">314</a>. He also served as an Expert for JSRs <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=154">154</a>, <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=245">245</a>, <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=273">273</a>, <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=276">276</a>, and <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=303">303</a>, influencing a variety of Java SE and Java EE projects. Ed spends a lot of his free time writing up his dual passions -- JSF and professional processes. He co-authored <i>JavaServer Faces: The Complete Reference</i> (2006) and its sequel, <i>JavaServer Faces 2.0, The Complete Reference</i> (2009). He is the sole author of <i>Secrets of the Rock Star Programmers: Riding the IT Crest</i> (2008). You can keep track of Ed through his <a href="http://ridingthecrest.com/edburns/">homepage</a> or his tweets <a href="https://twitter.com/edburns">@edburns</a>.
<P>

In the same year that the PMO pronounced Ed <i>Star Spec Lead</i> for 2009, the JCP community named him <i>Most Outstanding Java SE/EE Spec Lead</i> for his work on JSR 314. He is in demand as a speaker and has offered keynote addresses for the W-JAX conference in Munich, Germany, Globalcode Developer's Conference in S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil, and JSFDays conference in Vienna, Austria. In leading JSRs, he practices transparent communication by explaining new features and polling audiences through his blog, social media, online <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/javaserverfaces-139869.html#IRC">JSF chatroom</a>, conference engagements (JavaOne, JAOO, JAX, W-JAX, No Fluff Just Stuff, GlobalCode Developer's Conference, GeekOut, CON_FESS, The Ajax Experience), and Java and Linux user group meetings. Once a new version of a specification is released, Ed takes care to show how the final product reflects community input. He understands that we can't really call it a Java <i>Community</i> Process unless there is a closed loop between community input and the actual technology in the Java platform.

Nigel has spoken recently at JavaOne in San Francisco, USA, and at Devoxx in Antwerp, Belgium. He is based in Cambridge, UK.
<P>

Nigel says, "I consider JMS to be one of the most successful Java specifications ever, with a whole ecosystem of active implementations, both open- and closed-source. It is quite a small and simple specification, which I think has been key to its success: it has standardised the aspects important for application portability whilst leaving plenty of scope for different implementations to compete. My goal in leading the development of JMS 2.0 is to maintain this balance: to improve portability and add new features whilst allowing vendors to continue to innovate in this key enterprise technology."

Dr. Linda DeMichiel has had her fingers on the pulse of Java technology almost as long as it has had a pulse. While working on object relational databases for the exploratory databases group at the IBM Almaden Research Center back in the 1990s, she got involved with the emerging Java language, a big improvement over the C++ she was using at the time.
<P>

In 1997, Linda joined Sun Microsystems as the technical lead of the group working on Java Blend, an object relational mapping tool for Java persistence. Two years later, having driven the project to its first release, she was recruited to guide the development of Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) through the JCP program. Linda was thus involved in the JCP program from its very early days. Later, as the chief architect for EJB 3.0 and the Java Persistence API, she was responsible for driving many simplifications to the Java EE platform. She also participated as an Expert Group member on a number of JSRs led by other JCP member companies.
<P>

In 2003, Linda achieved the <i>Java Community Process Program Excellence Award</i>. The next year she was recognized as one of the most influential individuals in Enterprise Java, earning the <i>Who's Who in Enterprise Java</i>  2004 award by The Middleware Company. By 2005, she held <i>Star Spec Lead</i> status within the JCP program, and the JCP program awarded her <i>Outstanding Java SE/EE Spec Lead of the Year</i> 2006.
<P>

Now at Oracle, Linda leads a team of Java EE architects and specification leads who are responsible for the Oracle JSRs that are part of the Java EE Platform. She is also JCP specification lead for both the Java EE 7 Platform (<a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=342">JSR 342</a>) and the Java Persistence API (<a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338">JSR 338</a>).
<P>

Linda is a frequent speaker at conferences on Java technology and has been interviewed many times in the trade press. She has given presentations at every JavaOne since 1998 and has spoken many times at JavaPolis (now Devoxx), TheServerSide Symposium, JAX, Jazoon, JavaZone, and elsewhere. Some of her talks are available at <a href="http://www.parleys.com/">Parleys.com</a>, and her blog can be found at <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/ldemichiel/">here</a>. She holds a PhD in Computer Science from Stanford University and has more than twenty years of experience in the areas of databases, object persistence, and distributed computing.

 Dr. Jacob Feldman is the Founder and CTO of <a href="http://openrules.com/">OpenRules, Inc.</a>, a New Jersey corporation that created and maintains the popular open source business rules management system, commonly known as OpenRules&#174;. From 2006 through 2011, he was also Principal Investigator and Senior Research Fellow at <a href="http://4c.ucc.ie/">Cork Constraint Computation Centre</a> (4C), a world leading optimization research institution located in Cork, Ireland. He has extensive experience in development of decision-support software using rule engines, constraint solvers, and machine learning technologies for real world mission-critical applications. Five patents have been awarded to him in the field of business rules and constraint programming (CP).
<P>

During 2009, Jacob served as a member of the JCP ME Executive Committee and started <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=331">JSR 331</a>, Constraint Programming API, serving as the Spec Lead. The next year, the JCP community awarded JSR 331 <i>Most Innovative JSR</i> of 2010, with the statement, "This JSR represents the real innovation in SE/EE since the 300 number of JSRs started; where almost every other JSR especially in SE/EE is just an upgrade to existing technologies." Now Jacob is the Maintenance Lead for JSR 331, whose latest software can be downloaded <a href="http://openrules.com/jsr331/index.htm">here</a>. He remains enthusiastic about the tool, saying, "Constraint Programming (CP) gives regular software developers unprecedented power to address complex logical problems and lets them switch to declarative programming [in order to] concentrate on WHAT (problem definition) instead of HOW (problem resolution). CP brings fantastic algorithms developed by best scientists over decades to the practical world of application development, and all this comes without necessity to becoming optimization gurus." Jacob had always wanted to make CP a natural part of software development, and, as a Java developer himself, had felt the JCP program was the only practical vehicle for standardization. His hope is that JSR 331 helps bring CP to the real world of application development. 

Jacob graduated from the Mathematical Department of Gomel State University and defended his PhD in Computer Science in Moscow in 1986. His blogs about <a href="http://cpstandard.wordpress.com/">CP standards and JSR 331</a> and about <a href="http://openrules.wordpress.com/">OpenRules</a> have mentioned his participation in Object Management Group's Decision Modeling Notation (<a href="http://openrules.wordpress.com/2011/03/25/omg-decision-model-notation-dmn/">OMG DMN</a>) development. For a microblog, follow him <a href="https://twitter.com/Jacob_OpenRules">@Jacob_OpenRules</a>. His home base is in the greater New York City area, but he travels widely doing consulting, training, and presenting at international conferences on decision management, optimization, and practical AI.

David Nuescheler was instrumental in growing Day Software from a small multimedia agency to a global content management solution company. Since Day was acquired by Adobe Systems in 2010, David has become Vice President of Enterprise Technology. 
<P>

In 1999, David began working with Java technology after the decision was made to adopt the Java platform for Day's entire suite of products. Since then, he has worked as a solution and product architect primarily on server-side web projects, participating in numerous highly visible website content management projects for the world's largest organizations. He has shared his expertise with the OASIS standards organization, and by 2001, he had joined the JCP program, where he soon became Spec Lead for <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170">JSR 170</a>, Content Repository for Java Technology API. As soon as that effort wrapped up, he became Spec Lead for the next version, <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283">JSR 283</a>. He is now Spec Lead of <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=333">JSR 333</a>, Content Repository API for Java Technology 2.1. The RI and TCK for JSR 333 are being developed as open source under the <a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org/">Apache Jackrabbit Project</a> and through Java.net for <a href="http://java.net/projects/jsr-170-eg">JSR 170</a>, <a href="http://java.net/projects/jsr-283">JSR 283</a>, and <a href="http://java.net/projects/jsr-333">JSR 333</a>. (The package space of JSRs 170, 283, and 333 is javax.jcr, hence the use of codename JaCkRabbit.) 
<P>

David remains enthusiastic about content repositories, noting that they may be "the best of both worlds between relational databases and file systems." Features include transactionality and query using SQL from the relational database world as well as support hierarchies and dealing with large binary streams that are known from filesystems. He says, "A standardized content repository is the ideal store for almost any Java application." Twice, while he was working on content repositories, the JCP community nominated David <i>Most Outstanding Java SE/EE Spec Lead</i> (2009, 2005), and the PMO named him a <i>Star Spec Lead</i>. His technical prowess also landed him a guest appearance on <a href="http://tv.adobe.com/watch/max-2010-keynotes/adobe-max-2010-keynote-day-1-welcome-to-the-revolution-enterprise/">Adobe MAX TV 2010</a> to talk about the multi-screen aspect of customer experience management. And although he is nowhere near the end of his career, Best of Swiss Web 2008 <a href="http://www.itnewsbyte.com/de/news/nws145011,,.htm">honored</a> him with a <i>Lifetime Achievement</i> award.

 Bill Shannon is an Architect at Oracle, where he has worked since 1982. In the early years, he worked on the JavaMail API, the HotJava Views product, the Common Desktop Environment, the Solaris operating system, and all versions of SunOS. In more recent years, Bill became one of the primary architects of Java EE. Within the JCP program, he served as Spec Lead to revise the Java EE specification, leading <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=58">JSRs 58</a> (Java EE 1.3), <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=151">151</a> (Java EE 1.4), <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=244">244</a> (Java EE 5), <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=316">316</a> (Java EE 6), and <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=342">342</a> (Java EE 7). He has also acted as Maintenance Lead to update his earlier work through <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=904">JSR 904</a>, JavaMail Specification; <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=919">JSR 919</a>, JavaMail; and <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=925">JSR 925</a>, JavaBeans Activation Framework 1.1. 
<P>

By June 2005, Bill was awarded <i>Most Outstanding Spec Lead for Java Standard Edition/Enterprise Edition</i> at the annual JCP Awards ceremony. He earned this distinction for his technical acumen, his ability to build consensus among Experts who may not share identical goals, and his efficiency in guiding the development process. He was also inducted into the original <i>Star Spec Lead</i> <a href="http://jcp.org/en/press/news/specLeadStars/commFocusStarsHallOfFame">Hall of Fame</a>.
