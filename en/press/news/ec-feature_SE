Christer Boberg lives in Stockholm, Sweden and works as a technical expert within the Ericsson Networks department. At Ericsson, his main role is to drive architectural matters within the communication evolution program that are related to the WebRTC work done in W3C and IETF, and Ericsson&#39;s product offerings in that area.<BR/><BR/>

After a decade of programming C++/OO, he switched to Java 1.0 in the mid-90s and has stayed with Java in all of the products he handles. Christer also started the Ericsson Java Application Server work that later spun-off into the Sailfin cooperation with Sun. Since then, he has been working actively to promote and build Java solutions for Ericsson that meet the requirements for a carrier grade telecom solution.<BR/><BR/>

Somehow, Christer finds time to play in a Stockholm rock band named SoulPatrol.
