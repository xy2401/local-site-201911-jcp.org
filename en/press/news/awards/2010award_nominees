				<br>
  
<p>The dynamic, agile nature of the Java Community Process (JCP) program entails an ongoing reassessment of all activities and traditions. As usual, the community participated in nominating candidates for several awards related to efforts in 2010. However, this year's roster of awards reflects the Program Management Office (PMO) decision to combine the original six categories into a streamlined list of three: JCP Member of the Year, Outstanding Spec Lead, and Most Innovative Java Specification Request (JSR). 
</p>

<p>Winners in each category will be announced on September 22 at the Wednesday evening JCP community event held during the JavaOne 2010 conference. Winners and nominees are included permanently in the JCP program's <a href=http://jcp.org/en/press/news/awards/awards_main>hall of fame</a>. 
</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the community applauds all of the award nominees, for all of their work with the community, Java Standard Edition (SE), Java Enterprise Edition (EE), or Java Micro Edition (ME). Each nominee, introduced below, has earned the community's recognition and respect.

            		<li><a href=#colebourne>Stephen Colebourne</a>. Not only with JSR 310, but also in other areas, especially language improvements or Dynamic Languages on the JVM he continues his aim to help Java grow and mature.</li>
            		<li><a href=#lee>Bob Lee/Google</a>. Mainly for JSR 330.</li>
            		<li><a href=#redhat>Red Hat Middleware</a>.  For adapting JSR 330 into JSR 299. Despite a relatively tiny piece of software (JSR 330), it is a first step towards creating standards together with other companies instead of just following their own agenda ;-).</li>
				</ul>		  
                
				<div class="header3">Outstanding Spec Lead</DIV>
                <ul>
                	<li><a href=#bernard>Emmanuel Bernard</a> (Red Hat), JSR 303, Bean Validation.  Emmanuel ran one of the most open specifications in the JCP history, maintaining a public specification document, public forum discussions, public issue tracker and an Apache-licensed TCK and RI. He also demonstrated unparalled collaboration with other JSR groups. But his most notable contribution was his first, reviving a staled specification and taking over leadership from another party.</li>
                	<li><a href=#king>Gavin King</a> (Red Hat),  JSR 299, Contexts and Dependency Injection for the Java EE Platform. The role of a Spec Lead is not an easy one, but this specification took the challenge to a whole new level. What started out as an effort to integrate the JSF and EJB technologies became a specification that would stimulate a commitment to collaboration across the EE platform.</li>
                	<li><a href=#kim>Dave Kim</a> (SK Telecom), JSR 327, Dynamic Contents Delivery Service API for Java ME.</li>
                	<li><a href=#toegl>Ronald T?gl</a><font color="#ff6633"> * Winner *</font>, JSR 321, Trusted Computing API for Java. With his passion and continuous effort he not only brought JSR 321 to EDR stage despite a more than challenging time. He also inspired companies to adopt the JSR and implement against it already.</li>

                	<li><a href=#jsr299>JSR 299</a>, Contexts and Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform. Critics have foreshadowed the death of the Java language, claiming that there is little more than can be done to evolve it and therefore needs to be replaced. There have been similar claims that Java EE is becoming a legacy platform because it's not flexible enough to be extended. JSR 299 silenced these viewpoints.</li>

                  <strong>Outstanding Spec Lead</strong> - The role of Spec Lead is not an easy one, and the person who takes that responsibility must be, among other things, technically savvy, able to build consensus in spite of diverse corporate goals, and focused on efficiency and execution. This award recognizes the person who has brought together these qualities the best in the past year, in leading a JSR for the Java community (Java SE, Java EE or Java ME).

This JSR is a ground-up redevelopment of the date and time features in Java, including type-safe representations of major concepts like dates, time, months, periods and durations, as well as interoperation with common technologies such as XML and JDBC. Advanced features will provide Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) leap second support and full management of time zone rules. The specification, Reference Implementation (RI), and Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) are being developed in an open manner at https://jsr-310.dev.java.net/. Stephen is also valued for his contributions to Java language improvements where he co-wrote the middle-ground FCM closures proposal and provided the Kijaro workspace for anyone to hack the OpenJDK to add an experimental language feature. He has contributed to many core libraries, including Joda-Time (the forerunner of JSR 310), other Joda projects (money, convert, properties, beans), and Apache Commons. Through his blog he has contributed to the debate on the future of the JCP program, at times acting as an investigative journalist. Stephen has two talks at JavaOne as part of a busy speaking calendar.

<strong> <a name=lee></a>Bob Lee</strong<BR>
<p>As a Google employee, Bob Lee led the core library development for Android, created the Jolt award-winning Guice framework, served as Spec Lead for <a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.330.html">JSR 330</a>, Dependency Injection for Java, represented Google on the JCP SE/EE Executive Committee, and contributed significantly to several Java 7 language changes. In a little over four months, JSR 330 whipped through all the stages to achieve final release October 2009, making it the most expeditiously completed spec in the history of the JCP program. JSR 330 has been a welcome contribution to the industry because it specifies a means for obtaining objects in such a way as to maximize reusability, testability, and maintainability compared to traditional approaches such as constructors, factories, and service locators. The speed of JSR 330's adoption has rivaled that of its development. Spring and Guice implement JSR 330, and JSR 299 extends it. Bob Lee (http://crazybob.org/) has since migrated to Square, where he currently leads engineering. He continues participating in the JCP community as an individual member.

<strong> <a name=redhat></a>Red Hat Middleware</strong<BR>
<p>In keeping with its commitment to develop software that is compliant with all relevant standards, Red Hat Middleware LLC joined the JCP program in September 2003. Red Hat believes standards must be developed in an open manner, with strong community participation. Red Hat lives up to that premise, with energetic involvement in the development of approximately 25 JSRs, addressing a wide range of technologies that belong to the Java EE and Java SE platforms. Red Hat helps facilitate the vigorous developer and user feedback that is critical to the continued success of the JCP program. One specific example of Red Hat's willingness to collaborate with other companies occurred when Gavin King, the Red Hat Spec Lead for JSR 299, Contexts and Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform, helped bridge the worlds of Java SE and Java EE by producing a specification that integrates formally disparate technologies, including Java EE 6, the JSR 330 API, Enterprise JavaBeans 3.1, and JavaServer Faces 2.0.

<strong> <a name=bernard></a>Emmanuel Bernard</strong<BR>
<p>Emmanuel Bernard is Spec Lead for <a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.303.html">JSR 303</a>, Bean Validation, which he took over and revived from stagnation. This JSR is considered one of the most openly developed specifications in JCP program history in that Emmanuel maintained a public specification document, public forum discussions, public issue tracker, and an Apache-licensed Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) and Reference Implementation (RI). He also collaborated diligently and diplomatically with other JSR groups to attain tight integration within the Java SE and EE platform. As a result, JSR 303 not only made it into the Java EE 6 specification, but it has had a profound influence on simplifying and centralizing validation across all the layers of an application, making it simpler, more consistent, and more robust. Emmanuel also serves as an Expert Group member for JSR 317, Java Persistence 2.0. He is lead developer on the Hibernate team and platform architect at JBoss by Red Hat, and co-authored the book <i>Hibernate Search in Action</i>. He speaks regularly at various Java User Groups (JUGs) and conferences, including JavaOne, JBoss World, and Devoxx, and he blogs and tweets extensively.

<strong> <a name=jsr309></a>JSR 309, Media Server Control API</strong<BR>
<p><a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.309.html">JSR 309</a>, Media Server Control API, standardizes an Application Programming Interface that enables the development and deployment of new media-rich applications for the Java platform. This API is for use with the modern IP- and SIP-based media servers that are becoming essential for many of today's communications applications and that offer functions such as Intelligent Voice Response (IVR), voice/video conferencing and mixing, speech recognition, and text-to-speech services. Typical end-user services built upon these functions are Voicemail, Conferencing, Call Center, and Telephone Banking. This API also frees developers from knowledge of the underlying media server control protocols, works seamlessly with JSR 289 SIP Servlet API, simplifies their work, and allows them to focus on the rich media applications. Furthermore, the applications will be interoperable across a variety of protocols and media servers, resulting in a wider market reach for Java platform media applications. JSR 309 is a new style of JSR -- not just a bottom-up protocol driver, but a high-level API built top-down with a domain abstraction based on a study of rich-media application use-cases. The co-Spec Leads for this project are Marc Brandt of Hewlett Packard and Tomas Ericson of Oracle.

<strong> <a name=jsr299></a>JSR 299, Contexts and Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform</strong<BR>
<p><a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.299.html">JSR 299</a>, Contexts and Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform, was started mid-2006 by Spec Lead Gavin King of Red Hat Middleware LLC. Its release repudiates concerns that Java EE was not flexible enough to be extended. The JSR 299 Expert Group developed a programming model that combines the best of Jboss Seam, Google Guice, and Java EE, simplifies the programming model for web-based applications written in the Java language, and lays the foundation for a more consistent and better integrated EE platform. JSR 299's innovations include a novel use of annotations to improve the typesafety of Java code, and provision of an SPI (Service Provider Interface) for portable extensions to the Java EE platform. JSR 299 catalyzed the development of a unified notion of a Java EE component, which was eventually codified in the new Managed Bean specification. The Reference Implementation (RI) and Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) for JSR 299 were released under open source licenses, a first for Java EE platform technology.

<strong> <a name=jsr331></a>JSR 331, Constraint Programming</strong<BR>
<p>Constraint Programming (CP) is a proven problem solving technique with great practical applications in scheduling, resource allocation, configuration, and other areas. However, this powerful technology for years remained a prerogative of CP gurus. The objective of <a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.331.html">JSR 331</a>, Constraint Programming API, is to make CP technology more accessible for business software developers by defining unified business interfaces for modeling and solving real-world constraint satisfaction and optimization problems. Having these unified interfaces will allow commercial application developers to model their problems in such a way that the same model can be executed with different CP Solvers without any changes in the problem representation. This will minimize vendor dependence without limiting vendor innovation, while helping bring the latest research results to practical business applications. Dr. Jacob Feldman, a CTO at <a href=http://openrules.com>OpenRules, Inc.</a> and a senior research fellow at <a href="http://www.4c.ucc.ie">4C</a>, is the Spec Lead for this JSR. Related links:<br>

<strong> <a name=jsr327></a>JSR 327, Dynamic Contents Delivery Service API for Java ME</strong<BR>
<p><a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.327.html">JSR 327</a>, Dynamic Contents Delivery Service API for Java ME, is an optional package for Java ME enabled devices. The Application Programming Interface (API) provides three things. First, push-based content delivery facilitates the periodic delivery of customized content. Second, a uniform delivery mechanism works with a variety of network-enabled Java applications, regardless of data type or format. Third, a single point-to-point channel and/or broadcast communication for network-enabled applications uses currently available data transfer protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, or SMS. Dave Kim of SK Telecom is the Spec Lead for this project.
