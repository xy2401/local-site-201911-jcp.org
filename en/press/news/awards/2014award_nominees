						<div class="header1">The 12<sup><font size=-2>th</font></sup> JCP Annual Awards</div>
						<br>
						<p>
						The Java Community Process (JCP) program celebrates success. Members of the community nominate worthy participants, Spec Leads, and Java Specification Requests (JSRs) in order to cheer on the hard work and creativity that produces ground-breaking results for the community and industry in the Java Standard Edition (SE), Java Enterprise Edition (EE), or Java Micro Edition (ME) platforms.
						</p>
						<p>
						The community gets together every year at the JavaOne conference to applaud in person the winners the JCP Annual Awards.  This year we have four award categories: JCP Member/Participant of the Year, Outstanding Spec Lead, Most Significant JSR and Outstanding Adopt-a-JSR Participant. This year's unveiling will occur Monday evening, September 29, at the Annual JCP Community Party held in San Francisco at the Hilton Hotel.
						</p>
						<p>
						With great appreciation, now for the 12th year, the community recognizes the award nominees, listed below, with their nomination justifications.
						</p>

						&nbsp;<br>

<div class="header3">JCP Member/Participant of the Year</div>
<ul>

<LI><strong>Bruno Souza</strong><br><br>
His value added to the participation in the EC discussions as well as his leadership of 
the SouJava JUG has brought more attention to other JUGs and inspired their increased participation. 
<P>

<LI><strong>Heather VanCura</strong> <font color="#ff6633">* Winner *</font> <br><br>
Heather has taken a strong leadership role in the Adopt-a-JSR programme and has played a key role 
in organising and running Adoption sessions, workshops, webinars all around the world. Heather 
has also been tireless in bringing new Java User Groups into the programme. This work has played 
a significant role in making the JCP a well known entity that is seen to have relevance for 
developers. Also, for her Spec Lead role in JSR 364, that has the potential to significantly increase 
the participation of individual members of the Java development community in the work of the JCP. 
<P>

<LI><strong>Richard Warburton</strong><br><br>
Richard has put a huge amount of effort into the JCP. I have participated in the LJC Hack Days and 
have been very impressed with his welcoming encouragement, which has meant lots more people are 
now involved. This is great for Java and we need more like this! Richard has a great understanding 
of all things Java, and is good at explaining issues to new contributors, which really helps to encourage 
their participation.
<BR>
<BR>

</ul>		  
                
<div class="header3">Outstanding Spec Lead</div>
<ul>

<LI><strong>Stephen Colebourne (JSR 310)</strong><br><br>
Stephen was instrumental in bringing the Date & Time feature (JSR 310) to life in Java 8. Leading JSR 310 
was a substantial effort - both  personally and professionally - on Stephen's part. As Stephen has said, 
fixing Date & Time was primarily a matter of getting it "right", not fixing it "now".
<P>

<LI><strong>Michael Lagally (JSR 360)</strong> <font color="#ff6633">* Winner *</font> <br><br>
For bringing the first Java ME/CLDC update to Java in nearly 7 years! 
<P>

<LI><strong>Anatole Tresch (JSR 354)</strong><br><br>
Anatole has thrown himself into the Java Standards space as the Spec Lead for the Money and Currency JSR, 
the (soon to be submitted) Configuration JSR and as an active participant in several other JSRs. Anatole 
has shown great tenacity, patience and willingness to collaborate with stakeholders even when his JSRs 
come under strong/late change requests from outside parties! 
<BR>
<BR>

</ul>		  
                
<div class="header3">Most Significant JSR</div>
<ul>

<LI><strong><a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.310.html">JSR 310, Date & Time API</a></strong><br><br>
This JSR provides a long awaited/highly anticipated, new and improved date and time API for Java. 
<P>

<LI><strong><a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.360.html">JSR 360, Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDC) 8</a></strong> <font color="#ff6633">* Winner *</font> <br><br>
This JSR is a significant upgrade to Java ME after a very long quiet period, and is a major 
step toward convergence. Java ME 8 incorporates a large set of updated and new features, 
including: Java language and API alignment with Java SE 8, support for modern web protocols, 
a comprehensive application model, advanced security features and standard APIs for power management 
and interaction with a broad set of standard peripherals. 
<P>

<LI><strong><a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.363.html">JSR 363, Units of Measurement API</a></strong><br><br>
Aside from being one of the only non process-related (technical) JSR filed in the last 18 months, 
JSR 363 is the first JSR supporting both Java ME and SE with the same API. The EC was merged some 
while ago, but JSRs before were still designed for either Java ME or SE/EE. Even the category says 
Java SE, Java EE or Java ME, and JSR 363 works across all 3 of them.<P>
Several programming languages like C++, F# or Python offer type-safe semantic Units of Measurement 
support. Providing similar support to the Java Platform can help it to be competitive in the Internet 
of Things.<P>
By remaining closest to the "Write once Run Anywhere" promise Java once started with. And open to a 
future improved type system as well as modularity and optionality, JSR 363 is only the second JSR 
to use fine grained package level optionality after 361 (MEEP 8) .
<BR>
<BR>

</ul>		  

<div class="header3">Outstanding Adopt-a-JSR Participant</div>
<ul>

<LI><strong>JUG Chennai</strong><br><br>
JUG Chennai has been active adopting several JSRs from the Final 331 (Constraint Programming) 
to recent active JSRs like 354 (Money and Currency) or 363 (Units of Measurements) as well as 
JSRs under the Java EE 7 umbrella. They've also been demonstrating new features of Java EE 7, 
JavaFX or Java 8 on a regular basis and spread the word about Java at local JavaOne India 
conferences in Hyderabad.<P>
And for the last 4 years hosted its own Java conference Chennai Java Summit bringing several 
international Java experts and Java Champions to Chennai each year.
<P>

<LI><strong>iJUG/DOAG</strong><br><br>

The Association of German JUGs have done great work over the last year, in particular hosting 
an all day Adopt-a-JSR bonanza (where they kindly offered free tickets to Adopt-a-JSR participants) 
at their new Javaland conference! Much good came out of these sessions, in particular helping 
shape the Money and Currency JSR. 
<P>

<LI><strong>Ot&aacute;vio Gon&ccedil;alves de Santana</strong> <font color="#ff6633">* Winner *</font> <br><br>
Otavio, as part of SouJava, has significantly supported JSR 354 in changing its code base 
from Java 7 to Java 8. Otavio basically spent days of work just as a free contribution to 
our JSR with outstanding commitment and energy. Finally though Otavio worked only for a short time, 
he has definitively become one of the key contributors to JSR 354.<P>
Otavio is also a strong participant on OpenJDK, and came to join the Adotp-a-JSR program to help 
JSRs in general to be prepared to be included in OpenJDK. Having followed the process of JSR-310 
and the issues around it, Otavio has decided that JSRs would be better off adapting to OpenJDK from 
the start. Once Otavio joined the JCP, he really enjoyed participating, and ended up doing several tasks 
in JSR 354 and JSR 363. 
<P>

<LI><strong>Martijn Verburg</strong><br><br>
Martijn has put a huge amount of effort into the Adopt-a-JSR projects. I have participated in LJC Hack 
Days and have been very impressed with the welcoming encouragement, which has meant lots more people are 
now involved. This is great for Java and we need more like this! Martijn is very good at keeping track of 
the many JSRs he contributes to, and also the state / progress of other people working on them.

												<img src="/images/home/thumb_awards.gif" width="95" height="75" align="left"><strong>JCP Member/Participant of the Year</strong> - This award recognizes the corporate or individual member (either Member or Participant) who has made the most significant positive impact on the community in the past year. Leadership, investment in the community, and innovation are some of the qualities that EC Members look for in voting for this award. <br>&nbsp;<br>
						                  		<strong>Outstanding Spec Lead</strong> - The role of Spec Lead is not an easy one, and the person who takes that responsibility must be, among other things, technically savvy, able to build consensus in spite of diverse corporate goals, and focused on efficiency and execution. This award recognizes the person who has brought together these qualities the best in the past year, in leading a JSR for the Java community (Java SE, Java EE or Java ME). <br>&nbsp;<br>
						                  		<strong>Most Significant JSR</strong></strong> - Specification development is key to the success of the JCP program and helps ensure we remain a fresh and vibrant community. This award recognizes the Spec Lead and Expert Group that have contributed (either in progress or final) the most significant JSR for the Java community (Java SE, Java EE or Java ME) in the past year. <br>&nbsp;<br>
						                  		<strong>Outstanding Adopt-a-JSR Participant</strong></strong> - This award recognizes the Java User Group (JUG) that has made the most exemplary contribution through the Adopt-a-JSR program in the past year. The London Java Community and SouJava initiated, and are thereby implicitly recognized, in this effort for JUGs around the world to become more involved in the work of JSRs. Innovation, community engagement and technical impact are some of the characteristics that EC Members look for in voting for this award. <br>&nbsp;<br>
