<div class="header3">Most Innovative Java ME JSR</DIV>
<strong><a name=JSR248>JSR 248, Mobile Services Architecture</strong></a><br>
JSR 248 is the first of two specifications developed by the Mobile Service Architecture (MSA) initiative, a group of 14 major mobile industry players represented on the JSR Expert Group. The spec leads are from Nokia Corporation and Vodafone Group Services. The focus of the JSR is to specify an unfragmented, backwards compatible application development platform that supports a set of key APIs to a wide variety of features provided by the latest mass-market oriented handsets and mobile networks today and in the near future. JSR 248 does not introduce any new API specifications per se but includes a number of new component JSRs and clarifications/recommendations to existing specifications to define a consistent Java API services architecture. This will significantly reduce fragmentation and enable application compatibility across multi-vendor mobile devices. 
<BR><BR>
<strong><a name=JSR253>JSR 253: Mobile Telephony API (MTA)</strong></a><br> 
Led by Motorola and BenQ Corporation, JSR 253 enables applications to incorporate telephony features and controls directly into their operation, avoiding the need to pass focus to another application. One example of this might be in a multi-player game, allowing a voice call to be placed to other players in the game for strategy discussion (or taunting the enemies). Another use is the ability to incorporate a feature such as calling out to a help desk without exiting the application. Prior to JSR253 the use of telephony features led to the Java MIDlet losing focus to the telephony control application, something which can be problematic for troubleshooting. Providing control of these features allows the application to incorporate voice communication, without requiring additional development, and opening up all of the communication capabilities of the platform.
<BR><BR>
<strong><a name=JSR272>JSR 272, Mobile Broadcast Service API for Handheld Terminals</a></strong><br> 
Spearheaded by Nokia and Motorola JSR 272 defines the API for Mobile TV.  With the advances in mobile TV technologies like DVB-H, DMB, DAB, MediaFLO, bringing broadcast entertainment to your mobile phones is a reality.  But there are more that can be done than just watching TV using these technologies. JSR 272 provides the Java API to interface with the underlying broadcast service implementation to access the Electronic Service Guide; to interact with the media presentation; record contents and to manipulate any auxiliary data (including applications) that are broadcast with the media. Special attention is taken to accommodate purchasing, security and DRM specific to broadcast services.  JSR 272 is an enabler for interactive TV and rich media applications. JSR 272 targets compatibility with the CLDC/MIDP environment; enabling full interactive TV features with a relatively small and effective API.
<br><br>
<strong><a  name=JSR281>JSR 281, IMS Services API</a></strong><br>
The IMS Services API enables application programmers to easily create applications offering multimedia communication services in close integration with IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) according to applicable standards. In this way IMS domain, with all the advantages of merged Internet and Telco technologies, will be revealed to the broad JME developer community and will encourage faster adoption of the IMS services provided by the wireless networks. At least four types of functionality will be supported by the API: generic high-level IMS functionality, Push to Talk over Cellular (PoC) IMS Presence and Group List Management (GLM). JME developers will have a toolkit for creation of communication services being a combination of totally new communication style and standardized ones. The IMS Services API allows application developers for mobile devices to easily utilize the IMS functionality without requiring knowledge of the underlying SIP and IMS implementation details.

<div class="header3">Most Innovative Java SE/EE JSR</DIV>
<STRONG><A name="JSR244">JSR 244, Java EE 5</A></STRONG><BR>
JSR-244 defines Java EE 5, the latest version of the Java EE platform. Java EE 5 is the most significant release of the Java EE platform since the first version, J2EE 1.2. Java EE 5 significantly enhances the 
programming model, making it much easier to write enterprise applications. Java EE 5 makes extensive use of Java language annotations to greatly simplify the declarative programming style of Java EE. This is especially evident in the EJB 3.0, JAX-WS 2.0, JAXB 2.0, and Java Persistence 1.0 
technologies, which are included in the Java EE 5 platform. 
<BR><BR>
<STRONG><A name="JSR292">JSR 292, Supporting Dynamically Typed Languages on the Java Platform</A></STRONG><BR>
JSR 292 aims to provide sufficient support in the Java Virtual Machine(JVM) for implementors of dynamic languages to directly target the JVM's object model. This is significant because it will enable dynamically typed languages to leverage the high end performance capabilities of JVMs. We hope to accomplish this by allowing dynamically typed byte code to be executed efficiently yet safely, and by supporting the hotswapping facilities these languages need. 
<BR><BR>
<STRONG><A name="JSR220">JSR 220, EJB 3.0</A></STRONG><BR>
A leading JSR, EJB 3.0 is extremely innovative in a number of ways, from the technology that it defined to the process and practices that it  used to define it. It is the first specification group within the group of Java EE specifications that takes advantage of the new features of annotation 
metadata and parameterized types in Java SE 5. In particular, it defines a strategy for annotations usage subsequently adopted by JSR 244 for the Java EE Platform. It unifies the persistence world to produce a lightweight and integrated persistence specification that may also be used in a non-managed Java SE environment. The end result is a set of EJB and persistence specifications that merge accepted best practices with new technologies to form a technology that has already received wide acclaim even before reaching final draft.
