<strong> <a name=burns></a>Ed Burns</strong<BR>
Currently a senior staff engineer at Sun, and the author of two books, Ed Burns has influenced a variety of Java Standard Edition and Java Enterprise Edition projects. Currently a Star Spec Lead for 2009, Ed first got involved with the JCP program when he became co-Spec Lead of JSR 127, JavaServer Faces (JSF), a role he has continued through JSF 1.2 and now JSF 2.0, which is <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=314">JSR 314</a>. He operates his Expert Groups as transparently as possible, polling the community for suggestions, addressing those when possible, and pointing out where ideas were implemented. When people feel heard, they are more willing to adopt the technology. Ed takes advantage of social networking tools to communicate about JSR 314, and he prefers using the java.net project infrastructure for private communications within the group and for public feedback.

<strong> <a name=nuescheler></a>David Nuescheler</strong<BR>
As chief technology officer (CTO), David has been instrumental in growing Day Software into a global content management solution company. In 2002, he became Spec Lead for JSR 170, Content Repository for Java Technology API, continuing for the subsequent version, <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283">JSR 283</a>. To maintain an aggressive though flexible schedule, David focuses on communication, relying on the usual email list, plus weekly phone conferences and twice yearly face-to-face meetings. For every meeting, there is a simultaneous webmeeting with slides using webex. The RI and TCK for JSR 170 are being developed as open source under the Apache Jackrabbit Project, at jackrabbit.apache.org, or at jsr-283.dev.java.net. Downloadable materials are viewable by anyone and updated even more frequently than the formal review periods mandated by the JCP program. David was named a Star Spec Lead for 2009.

<strong> <a name=glahn></a>Kay Glahn and Erkki Rysa</strong<BR>
Kay Glahn, Consultant Mobile Service Architecture for Vodafone Group Services Limited, and Erkki Rysa, Technology Manager at Nokia, are co-Spec Leads of <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=249">JSR 249</a>, Mobile Service Architecture (MSA2). This JSR is key in defining the Java technology platform for future mobile devices. Kay and Erkki rescoped the JSR and then made significant progress in moving it along to its final stages while aligning the diverse requirements of the industry players represented in the Expert Group. They made the Expert Group's work practices as effective as possible, documenting decisions and action items from every conference call and meeting, and storing all documents, proposals, and comments in a database that all Experts can access. An Observer mailing list that anyone can join helps keep the process transparent. Every proposal or a comment received from the outside is treated with the same consideration those originating within the Expert Group, and Kay and Erkki believe the broad input has resulted in a significantly richer JSR.

<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=281">JSR 281</a>, IMS Services API, is co-led by two Ericsson employees, Piotr Kessler and Stefan Svenberg. Piotr serves as chief architect of client software in the service layer, while Stefan is a senior staff engineer implementing JSRs in Ericsson mobile platforms. They intend for their work to be end-user oriented, and continue to pay close attention to the business for new IMS services as well as for evolving IMS standards. The agility of their process is reflected in the speed of their download postings - after the final release of the original JSR in July 2008, they released two maintenance draft reviews and achieved final maintenance release just nine months later. The new release includes useful improvements, clarifications, and corrections. The Reference Implementation was released as open source under an Apache license.

He is a 2009 Star Spec Lead for <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=271">JSR 271</a>, Mobile Information Device Profile 3, whose Expert Group encompasses over 120 participants, a deliberately broad representation of device manufacturers, operators and carriers, and content developers. Mike had to employ special processes and tools to accommodate such a large team, such as incorporating issues trackers and document repositories, as well as online discussion forums for each functional area. All discussions, javadoc/html sources, documents, issues, Wiki pages, and so forth were openly available to any Expert Group member.

<strong> <a name=jsr310></a>JSR 310, Date and Time API</strong<BR>
<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310">JSR 310</a>, a new Date and Time API for the Java Platform, proposes an advanced, comprehensive model for date and time manipulation and a coherent feature set, including representations of date without time, time without date, durations and intervals, among others. It is based on the ISO8601 standard and designed to work properly with other common technologies, such as XML and JDBC. The intent is for it to become part of a future Java SE platform release. The specification, RI and TCK are being developed in a completely open manner at https://jsr-310.dev.java.net/ under the guidance of co-Spec Leads Stephen Colebourne and Michael Nascimento Santos.

<strong> <a name=jsr301></a>JSR 301, Portlet Bridge Specification for JavaServer(TM) Faces Technology</strong<BR>
<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=301">JSR 301</a> (and <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=329">329</a>) defines the technology needed to publish a JSF application as a portlet regardless of the portlet container, Faces implementation, or set of Faces extensions that an application relies on. In essence, JSR 301 (and 329) brings the ease and breadth of JSF programming to the portlet community. JSR 301 defines the specifics of this technology when running JSF 1.2 in a Portlet 1.0 container (while JSR 329 does the same for a Portlet 2.0 container). Future versions are planned for JSF 2.0 support. The Spec Lead for this project is Michael Freedman of Oracle.

<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=316">JSR 316</a>, JavaTM Platform, Enterprise Edition 6 (Java EE 6) Specification, is defining the next version of the Java EE platform. It introduces powerful new facilities to make the platform more flexible for users and vendors alike. Profiles allow the creation of focused bundles of technologies that address the needs of a particular class of applications. Pruning enables us to shrink the platform by selectively removing superseded JSRs. The Spec Lead for this project is Roberto Chinnici.

<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=271">JSR 271</a>, MIDP3, builds on the success of MIDP2 by enhancing the profile with features that include over-the-air deliverable-shared libraries for MIDP. This enables a new market for MIDP middleware developers; the ability to run multiple concurrent MIDlet suites simultaneously within a single VM; and the ability to run MIDlets on CLDC, CDC, or OSGi environments. All of this is being added while maintaining the important goal of backward compatibility with MIDP2 content. The Spec Lead for this project is Brian Deuser of Motorola.

<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=327">JSR 327</a>, Dynamic Contents Delivery Service API for Java ME, is a Java ME enabled device optional package that will provide three things. First, push-based content delivery that facilitates the periodic delivery of customized content. Second, a uniform delivery mechanism for various network-enabled Java applications regardless of data type or format. Third, a single point-to-point channel and/or broadcast communication for network-enabled applications, using currently available data transfer protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, or SMS. Dave Kim of SK Telecom is the Spec Lead for this project.

<strong> <a name=jsr325></a>JSR 325, IP Multimedia Subsystem Communication Enablers (ICE)</strong<BR>
JSR 281 brought IMS to mobile clients, and now <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=325">JSR 325</a>, IMS Communication Enablers (ICE) will provide application developers an API for writing cool IMS applications based on high-level standardized services. The fact that JSR 325 is based on already standardized IMS service enablers will make applications interoperable not only with other JSR 325 applications but also with native applications. The co-Spec Leads for this project are Martin Johansson and Niclas Palm of Ericsson.
