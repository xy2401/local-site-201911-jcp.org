Victor Grazi is an Oracle Java Champion. He has been at Credit Suisse since 2005, where he works 
in Investment Banking Architecture on platform architecture, and as a technical consultant and 
Java evangelist. He is also a trainer, columnist, and frequent presenter at technical conferences 
(such as JavaOne, JavaZone, Jazoon), and Java User Group (JUG) meetings, where he speaks about his 
first love, Java concurrency, as well as other Java-related topics. He says, "As numbers of processors 
and cores grow and chip designers start taking advantage of memory model optimizations, developers 
will need to be more cognizant of concurrency features they closed an eye to in the past." 
Victor created and hosts the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/javaconcurrenta/">Java Concurrent 
Animated</a> open source project on SourceForge. 
<P>

Victor co-represents Credit Suisse on the JCP EC and is the Spec Lead 
of <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=354">JSR 354</a>, Java Money and Currency API. This API allows 
for representing, transporting, and performing comprehensive calculations with monetary values and regional 
currency rules.
<P>

Victor has been fascinated with numbers since he was a youngster. At New York City's Brooklyn Technical 
High School he was a top scorer on one of the top Math teams in the USA. He holds a bachelor's in Math 
from Syracuse University in New York (1976) and also studied Math at Columbia University in New York (1977). 
Victor's love of math turned into a fascination with programming when, at Syracuse University, students were 
granted $50 worth of computer time per semester. He says, "I would tear through that in a few days learning 
early languages like Fortran, APL, and Forth, but I never had any trouble finding people who were more than 
happy to gift me their time. I developed a love for computers because, unlike people, they did what they 
were told, and if they didn't it was your fault not theirs!" In 1996, he started a dot com company based on 
a sophisticated Java applet, which launched his career in Java.
<P>

Victor communicates to the world through Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/vgrazi">@vgrazi</a> 
and <a href="http://vgrazi.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>. He is editor and columnist for Credit Suisse's 
internal <i>Inside IT</i> magazine. He lives in Brooklyn, New York with his wife and family. In 2008, 
Victor was honored for his nearly ten years of volunteer work with the Career Services, meeting weekly 
to help people develop basic computer skills useful on the job. In 1999, he was inducted as a member of 
American Mensa.

<div>
Manik Surtani is determined to make "technology work for mankind" and not the other way around. 
He co-founded a startup in 1998, building online knowledge-exchange systems. As the systems, 
originally built in PHP and C, grew more complex, the need to transition to Java became obvious. 
The advantages included tooling, rich libraries, active and healthy community of developers, and 
a burgeoning collection of open source application servers and runtimes. Manik fell hard for the 
technology, becoming a Java EE consultant for five years, working mainly on mission critical highly 
available systems.
<P>

Manik became Lead R&D Engineer at JBoss for a year before Red Hat, Inc. acquired the company in 2006. 
That same year, Manik joined the JCP program to become an Expert Group member for 
<a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107">JSR 107</a>, JCACHE - Java Temporary Caching API, 
and, much later, Spec Lead of <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=347">JSR 347</a>, 
Data Grids for the Java Platform. Now a Senior Principal Software Engineer at JBoss/Red Hat, Manik is 
founder and project lead of Infinispan, an open source data grid and cloud storage platform, and of 
Red Hat's related Enterprise Data Grid product. He co-founded JClouds, a multi-cloud portability library 
for Java, was lead engineer on JBoss Cache, and was a core contributor on a number of other JBoss 
products, including JGroups, and the clustering and high availability features in the JBoss Application 
Server, Hibernate. Infinispan, JBoss Cache, and JGroups are core building blocks to many Java-based 
clustering solutions. Manik is also a committee member of the London Java Community (LJC), a large, active JUG.
<P>

Manik holds several patents, most of which are in the area of distributed computing. He has a BSc, 
with first class honors, in Computing, from the University of Wales, Swansea (1997). Although his 
academic background involved research in artificial intelligence and neural networks, his current 
interests lie in cloud and distributed computing, autonomous systems, and highly available computing. 
He is a champion of open source processes. His Devoxx 2010 presentation on "Hacking Infinispan" is 
available on <a href="http://www.parleys.com/">Parleys.com</a>. Manik communicates through 
a <a href="http://manik.surtani.org">homepage</a>, a <a href="http://blog.infinispan.org">blog</a>, 
and Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/maniksurtani">@maniksurtani</a>. For fun, he climbs mountains,

Mitch Upton is a Principal Member of Technical Staff at Oracle, working in the Fusion Middleware 
Webservices team as the lead engineer for fundamental technologies such as reliable messaging, 
clustering, and persistence. He represents Oracle within the JCP program, serving as Spec Lead 
of <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=350">JSR 350</a>, Java State Management. 
<P>

Previously, before joining Sun, now Oracle, in 2008, he represented BEA as a member of the Expert 
Group for <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=112">JSR 112</a>, J2EE Connector Architecture 1.5, 
as well as for the privately co-developed (non-JCP) Enterprise Metadata Discovery specification with 
IBM. In the application integration space, Mitch holds some exclusive US patents and many co-invented 
patents. Other projects throughout his career include designing a J2EE-based human workflow product 
and application integration product, an automated process flow engine, a high speed Online Transaction 
Processing (OLTP) system for tracking customer account activity, and a client/server system to assist 
in tracking projects and billing customers. 
<P>

Java technology first got Mitch's attention when he was asked to write a user-interface toolkit that could 
be used on multiple platforms. He says, "Java was a natural fit. The cleanliness of the language along 
with built-in threading made it instantly invaluable in this effort." He is committed to developing APIs 
that clearly and succinctly reflect how a customer wants to work with features he writes. "Java offers 
a very clean and highly expressive set of language elements and utilities that makes this possible," he says. 
Moreover, Mitch recommends using off-the-shelf components rather than reinventing the wheel, and the Java 
language supports that. He says, "No other language offers the wealth of standard APIs and open-source 
implementations that Java does."

Mitch co-wrote the WebLogic-focused chapter in <i>J2EE Connector Architecture and Enterprise Application 
Integration</i> (2001), by Rahul Sharma, Beth Stearns, and Tony Ng. Mitch holds a bachelor's in Physics 
from the University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado (1989). He lives nearby in Denver, where he telecommutes 
to work. To take a break, he works on hot rods as an amateur mechanic and goes camping or does other 
outdoorsy activities.

Since August 2009, Cheng Wang has been employed by Nokia Mobile Phones, a company that was twice 
nominated <i>Member of the Year</i> by the JCP community (2008, 2005). Cheng is now the Feature software 
head in the Java development area of Nokia. In previous years, he has also worked for Motorola, BenQ, 
and Siemens - all active members of the JCP community at one time or another. 
<P>
Cheng's interest in Java technology was ignited specifically in 2002, when he was working at Siemens 
on a Personal Information Management (PIM) implementation of 
<a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=75">JSR 75</a>, PDA Optional Packages for the J2ME Platform. 
However, it wasn't until June 2012 that he has been able to participate directly in the JCP program. 
Now he represents Nokia on the Executive Committee. He is also the Maintenance Lead for several Nokia-led JSRs.
<P>
Cheng completed a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Beijing University of 
Technology (1992). He lives in Beijing, China, where he enjoys spending time with his young son.
