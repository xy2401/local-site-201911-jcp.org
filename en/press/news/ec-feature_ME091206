Brian Deuser is passionate about software testing, conformance testing, and quality assurance.  In his 10+ years at Motorola, his knack for
requirements-based System Testing lead him to create Motorola's LWT (LOC) TCK.  Quickly becoming Motorola's TCK expert and Standards-based
testing evangelist, Brian has led the creation of every TCK released by Motorola.  Along with creating Gatling, Motorola's zero cost and 
open source Java ME test framework, Brian is the chief architect of the MIDP 3.0 TCK.  As part of the JCP, Brian represents Motorola as 
the Specification Lead for JSRs 271 (Mobile Information Device Profile 3.0), 37, 118, 253, 304, and 307, and he has served as an 
Expert Group member for JSRs 248 & 249 (MSA), and JSR 306.

Nokia is an  active member in the JCP program whose strong contribution stems from  a desire to make Java technology competitive and able to serve as a  common, global application platform. Pentti brings his experience in  software R&amp;D, sales, industry collaborations, and standardization.  He currently works in Nokia Technology Platforms as director of Java  Platform Standardization. He leads a team responsible for the creation  and licensing of two-thirds of nearly 30 JSRs that Nokia is leading,  including those on Mobile Service Architecture. He also heads up other  Java technology related industry cooperation beyond the JCP in hopes  of increasing the competitiveness of Java technology, sharing  technologies between the JCP program and other standards bodies, and  creating a consistent standardized Java application platform for  mobile devices. Pentti hopes to promote rules within the EC that make  JCP standards widely available for implementers under predictable and  consistent terms and without unreasonable restrictions. </div>		  &nbsp;<span class="style1">

		 Philippe Lucas is director of standardization at Orange, a member  of the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) Board of Directors, and holds a seat  on the ME EC. He credits the JCP for delivering APIs for mobile phones  that drive games and multimedia services. Orange will work to enlarge  the community of companies involved in the JCP program and to ensure  the process can be more open. Security and certification are the most  compelling aspects to be addressed in the JCP program, Philippe says.  For example, Orange will strive to make sure that no application can  be deployed using bearer capabilities without customer awareness. This  is vital because of the lack of trust customers could have with  third-party applications, he says. In the future, Philippe expects the  JCP program to encourage the development of specifications related to  IP-based Multimedia Services (IMS).</div>
