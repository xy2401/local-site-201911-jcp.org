The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) was named
the JCP MEMBER OF THE YEAR 
for having made the most significant positive impact on the community 
through a demonstration of leadership, investment in the community, 
and innovation. This membership-based, non-profit corporation provides 
organizational, legal, and financial support for a large number of 
Java-based, open-source software projects, including Apache Tomcat, 
Apache Maven, Apache Ant, the many components of Apache Jakarta Commons, 
Apache Struts, and Apache Geronimo, among many others.

 A member of the JCP since its founding and an EC member since the Executive Committees 
were formed, the ASF has worked closely with fellow EC members to bring about important 
changes to the JCP program. For example, Reference Implementations (RIs) and Technology 
Compatibility Kits (TCKs) are now allowed to be developed as open-source technology, and 
a scholarship program was set up to provide free TCK licenses and support for qualified 
non-
profits, individuals, and academics. The ASF hosts the source bases for several RIs 
and has many independent compatible implementations of JSRs, and ASF representatives serve in 
numerous Expert Groups.
 <br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 As the ASF's representative on the EC, Geir Magnusson Jr. 
accepted the award. He says, "We focused on bringing the principles and 
benefits of community-based, collaborative open source to the JCP, helping 
put the 'Community' in Java Community Process. Expert Groups are starting to 
work in an open manner. There are lots of benefits to transparency."

Other Nominees</div>
<strong>NOKIA</strong><br>
Through the end of 2004, Nokia has shipped Java technology in approximately 180 million 
devices and in more than 90 different device models based on the Series 40 Platform, 
Series 60 Platform, and Series 80 Platform. Through this platform approach, Nokia offers 
the highest volume opportunities for mobile developers. To contribute toward the Java 
community's creation of leading-edge Java technologies, Nokia has been an active member in the 
Java Micro Edition EC since its establishment in 2000. Nokia has also taken the lead, with key 
partners throughout the industry, in more than ten essential JSRs in the mobile space, including 
two JSRs for the Mobile Service Architecture (MSA) initiative -- JSR 248 MSA for CLDC and JSR 249 MSA 
for CDC. In recent months Nokia finalized work on a number of JSRs for mobile devices, including JSR 226 
Scalable 2D Vector Graphics, JSR 234 Advanced Multimedia, and JSR 238 Mobile Internationalization APIs. 
Nokia also made good progress on JSR 257 Contactless Communication and JSR 256 Mobile Sensor APIs. Nokia 
will continue to work with its industry partners to deliver exciting new experiences and features to 
mobile phone users.
 <br>&nbsp;<br>
<strong>SIEMENS</strong><br>
Siemens is a leading member of the JCP Executive Committee (Java Micro Edition), 
leads or co-leads more than 10 JSRs, and has experts in several other JSRs. For Siemens' more than 30,000 software developers, Java is a major language and platform for Siemens products and services. Siemens is committed to the JCP to actively shape Java's future together with the JCP community.
 <br>&nbsp;<br>
<strong>ORANGE FRANCE SA</strong><br>

Orange's contribution to the JCP program started in 2001 with JSR 118 MIDP 2.0, 
the first JSR in which an Orange representative participated as an Expert. 
Including that first step, Orange has been involved in twelve Micro Edition 
JSRs (118, 120, 135, 177, 185, 209, 248, 249, 253, 257, 271, and 272). 
Orange's first major and significant contribution was a joint work with 
other members of the wireless industry present at the JCP, the MIDP 2.0 
security framework, which is now recognized as the best application security 
solution in the wireless industry. Orange's commitment to bringing a rich, secure, 
interoperable and reliable Java experience to the end user has motivated and shaped 
all its Expert Group participations and contributions. In 2004, Orange joined the 
JCP EC to bring the same message to that level.

    <br>
    &nbsp;<br>
  Eric is a distinguished member of the technical staff at Motorola and a member of the Java-Linux 
  software platform architecture team for the mobile devices business. He has focused on telephony 
  control APIs for the Java-Linux platform architecture, as well as connectivity protocols. Eric's 
  involvement in the JCP started with JSR 253, which merged his experience developing APIs at Motorola 
  with Siemens' work in this area. Eric says their combined experience helped get JSR 253 off to a quick 
  start by providing a sound starting point for the JSR and the necessary technical expertise to guide 
  development of the specification and resolve issues.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.271.html">JSR 271</a> Mobile Information Device Profile 3 
(MIDP3) received THE MOST INNOVATIVE JSR for Java Micro Edition award. MIDP3 
enhances the MIDP2 profile with features that include over-the-air deliverable 
shared libraries for MIDP, while maintaining MIDP2 content backward compatibility. 
These new features, which enable a new market for MIDP middleware developers, 
consist of the ability to run multiple concurrent MIDlet suites simultaneously within
 a single VM and the ability to run MIDlets on CLDC, CDC, or OSGi environments. 
 A substantially richer user interface is also included, as well as support for secondary displays, secure RMS stores, removable media, multiple network interfaces, Internet Protocol Version 6, extensive device capabilities query, and so forth. Spec Lead Jim Van Peursem of Motorola accepted the award.

<a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.257.html">JSR 257</a> <br>
Contactless Communication API
Technologies based on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Near Field Communication (NFC) summon an increasing share of attention. RFID technology can be used in item identification, for example, and NFC technology enables peer-to-peer communication between two NFC devices. These technologies open new and innovative application areas. Jaana Majakangas of Nokia is the Spec Lead for JSR 257 Contactless Communication API to provide a Java API for these technologies. With JSR 257 the developer can extend the use of RFID and NFC technologies into mobile applications. In addition, JSR 257 gives mobile Java applications access to the information on the bar codes. Bar codes are already widely used all around the world, so this opens up new application areas for the developers.
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.259.html">JSR 259</a><br>
Ad Hoc Networking API enables communication between mobile devices in a bearer agnostic peer-to-peer ad hoc network environment. This generic programming interface provides all necessary interfaces, tools, and abstractions to quickly build P2P Java applications that allow two devices to interact in a service provider-consumer model environment. JSR 259 makes it possible to use the same Java application to transparently access a UPnP or a Rendez-Vous enabled Printer. Jean-Yves Bitterlich of Siemens AG is the Spec Lead for JSR 259.

"Spec Leads are the unsung heroes in the whole Java process, and anything we can do 
for the outstanding ones is good. Super Spec Leads have been chosen so far," says EC 
member Mike DeNicola, director of Industry Relations for Fujitsu. Mike feels this is 
an excellent start for making the process more open within the community and visible 
to the public. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
As a Star who knows, Jere Kapyaho of Nokia, agrees. "Spec Leads don't do much that is 
visible, but their work load is significantly greater than a regular Expert Group 
member. I appreciate the gesture and I hope it continues and gets more people." 
In his group at Nokia, Jere is known for being an approachable mentor. When his 
coworker Jaana Majakangas became Spec Lead of JSR 257, she relied on Jere for 
advice. "I can see why he's a Star Spec Lead. I can see how people need experienced 
Spec Leads to talk to. This program is great for helping new Spec Leads know who to 
contact," she says. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Greg Czajkowski, a Senior Staff Engineer at Sun Microsystems and Spec Lead for JSR 
121 hopes to hear more about the Stars' best practices. "There are so many different 
Expert Groups and styles. I'd like to know if something is common in successful Expert Groups." Greg and others can read the <a href="/en/press/news/star">Stars' profiles</a> to uncover some of 
the important factors in their work ethic and process.

&nbsp;<br>
                The program, designed to encourage all Spec Leads to aspire to Stardom, is perceived as

&nbsp;<br>
                Suresh Chitturi, another senior research engineer for Nokia and a Spec Lead for JSR 
				226, is now considering how he can someday become a Star. He believes that the leadership 
				skills seen in a Star are typically gained by serving as a Spec Lead multiple times. He 
				also sees the value placed on networking and helping mentor the other people in his 
				organization.
