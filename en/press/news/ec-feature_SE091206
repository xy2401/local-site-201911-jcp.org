In that  regard, the JCP plays a central role and Sacha hopes to see the number  of participants in the JCP grow even more to make sure the needs of  the Java community are still strongly represented, and do not simply  represent the interests of its biggest vendors. He says, "While  the balance is not always easy to find, Sun has done a pretty good job  at stewarding Java. Furthermore, Sun's recent announcement towards a  broader openness is also a great step in a good direction."</div>
