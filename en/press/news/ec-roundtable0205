      The Executive Committees (EC), the broad oversight boards chartered to guide the 
	  development and evolution of Java technologies. 2004 represents the fifth annual 
	  EC elections, the ECs were first
        elected by the JCP membership in the fall of 2000. There are two ECs. 
		The <strong>Standard/Enterprise Edition (SE/EE) EC</strong> oversees the 
		Java technologies for the desktop/server space (with
        responsibility for the J2SE and J2EE specifications). The <strong>Micro 
		Edition (ME) EC</strong> that oversees the Java technologies for the 
		consumer/embedded space(with responsibility for the
        J2ME specifications). Each EC has 16 members, 10 Sun nominees that were 
		ratified by JCP members and 5 elected members from a pool of self-nominated 
		companies and organizations. Terms are three years. Sun also holds a seat on each committee.

			If the newly elected members of the Java 
			Community Process (JCP) program 
			Executive Committees (EC) were issuing report cards, the JCP program would 
			get good grades in an important subject -
			Playing Well With Others. In the IT world, that subject means collaboration 
			and compatability. The winners in the recently completed EC elections for the Standard/Enterprise Edition (SE/EE) slots were
			Apache Software, Borland, Nortel Networks, Google, Jboss and Intel. The Micro 
			Edition (ME) winners were NTT DoCoMo, Samsung, Research in Motion, Intel and Orange France.

		<strong>Bill Bourne</strong> is a solutions architect for Nortel, which for the first 
		time represents the telecommunications industry on the SE/EE EC. He says the JCP program 
		is a mature, efficient, effective process
	    that is becoming more friendly to alternative business models of collaboration, such as 
		open-source business processes. "Making Java technology play well 
		with other software platform architectures
	    and ensuring that Java technologies play effectively in a utility 
		computing environment are keys to a productive future," he says.
		<br>&nbsp;<br>
        Bourne says the JCP program is key to avoiding "one of the big productivity 
		killers in software development, what a friend of mine 
		calls 're-inventing the flat tire.'" That, Bourne says, "is
  	re-inventing the wheel, except the re-invention is not as good as the original!"

		<strong>Takeshi Natsuno</strong> is managing director of Multimedia Services for NTT DoCoMo, 
		a new member of the ME EC that will strengthen Asian-Pacific representation. Natsuno agrees that the JCP
		  program is crucial to avoding flat tires in technology. "The JCP program is well balanced 
		  and moving quickly to correspond to market demands" he says. "I believe that we can continue
		  to make great strides."
  		  <br>&nbsp;<br>
          Led by the EC, JCP program members collaborate to define the Java technology binary 
		  standard leading to compatible implementations and solutions that developers and the industry can trust in areas
          such as web services, wireless, tools and vertical industries. The current version, 
		  JCP 2.6, promotes public availability of specifications during their development, ensures the right of Spec Leads
          to deliver their technologies under a license of their choosing and ensures broad community 
		  participation in the open development of Java technology standards.
  		  <br>&nbsp;<br>
          The results speak volumes. About a third of the 250 plus submitted JSRs have completed, 
		  led by over 55 organizations and individuals. They include such advances as two versions of the Java Micro
          Edition (CLDC/MID-P), three versions of the Java Standard Edition and three versions 
		  of the Java Enterprise Edition. In addition to Java technology iinterfaces for XML, web services, tools and
          vertical industries such as telecommunications.
  		  <br>&nbsp;<br>
  		  Still, the representatives agree that much work is left to be done. Marc Fleury founded 
		  Atlanta-based JBoss in 2001 to provide professional services for customers of the open source JBoss Application
	      Server. Fleury, a new EC member, says the JCP program needs to speed up and be more aggressive 
		  in the technologies it standardizes. "We must make sure that the 'allies' in the Java
	      camp remain united and resist the urge to go proprietary," he says. 
		  <br>&nbsp;<br>
	      That involves playing well with other developers through the JCP program. "There's 
		  no better way to develop a deep knowledge of a package than to help develop the specs for it," says
	      Josh Bloch, a Principal Engineer for Google, a new EC member. "You meet lots of 
		  smart and influential men and women on JCP expert groups. They become part of your network."

				Technology Group at Intel, where he has led or contributed to a number of 
				advanced software research and development
			projects. These have included work in programming languages and systems, 
			systems management, and security. He says the JCP is already a key provider of technology to the industry, and that
		its importance will continue to grow. So being involved, he says, is vital. &quot;Participation in the 
		process is absolutely the best way to learn what is needed and help make it happen.&quot;

					  Dittert says the JCP is &quot;putting out great specs, but, especially in the J2ME space, 
					  there are several areas in which we could improve: architectural coherence, timeliness -- 
					  that is, being ahead of the needs of the market, and
	          licensing that enables rapid adoption of Java technology.&quot;
	          He believes JTWI (JSR 185) was a start toward architectural coordination, 
			  but &quot;we need to press forward with MSA to ensure that
	          application developers have a solid, well-known target platform.&quot;
	          On the subject of licensing, Dittert favors transparency and commonality.
	  &quot;Open, uniform licensing practices would speed up adoption a lot,&quot; he says.
	  &quot;Also, it would be a huge step forward if we, as a community, could find a way to 
	  develop TCKs more efficiently so that they are less of a burden to spec leads and 
	  more cost-effective for independent implementors.&quot;

				<strong>Orange: <em>Philippe Lucas</em></strong><br>
				Philippe Lucas is director of standardization at Orange and is a member of the 
				Open Mobile Alliance Board of Directors. He credits the JCP for delivering APIs for mobile phones that drive
				games and other services. He says Orange will work to enlarge the community of 
				companies involved in the JCP process and to make it more open. Orange also wants 
				to ensure that elements such
				as security and billing-related services are addressed, Lucas says. "Orange is 
				bringing all its technical expertise in this field to ensure that the JCP 
				works with the community of large developers
				so more applications to reach the mobile phones," he said. 
				<br>&nbsp;<br>
				Security and certification are the most compelling aspects to be addressed in the JCP, 
				Lucas says. For example, Orange will strive to make sure that no application can be deployed using
				bearer capabilities without customer awareness. This is vital because of the lack of 
				trust customers could have with third-party application, he says.
			<br>&nbsp;<br>
				In the future, Lucas says he expects the JCP to be play a vital role as usage of 
				IP based services increases, more attention is paid to increasing data 
				applications and more of these applications
	    are deployed in mobile devices. "The platforms to support multimedia must be 
		simple and reliable to deploy applications in most devices with a large common core," Lucas said. "Otherwise
	    we won't be able to use the full capabilities and the data applications will 
		take more time to generate additional revenue for the whole industry."

						Nobuhisa Yoda is Research in Motion's director of Standards and Licensing Japan, 
						part of the Global Standards team that spearheads technology standards activities at forums around the world. "The
	    success of the JCP process is evident," Yoda says. He notes that BlackBerry devices are based on 
		the Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME) standard, including CLDC and MIDP specifications. "It is
	    vital to stay focused on providing business and technical solutions that satisfy real customer 
		requirements and deliver a strong ROI," he says. 
				<br>&nbsp;<br>
				
				Yoda says that as technologies become more sophisticated, the biggest challenge for the 
				EC is ensuring that the process continues to foster innovative ideas in a co-opertive environment. "As
	    the need to wirelessly access corporate resources in a secure and efficient manner continues to 
		grow, there will be an increased use of Java-based mobile devices as part of companies' overall
	    enterprise solutions," Yoda says. . Accordingly, the community process will need to ensure that 
		the various technologies that support J2EE, J2SE or J2ME can work together to build an end-to-end
	    solution that extends robust enterprise systems to mobile environments. To drive this 
		interoperability, the JCP process must continue to foster openness and innovativeness and also coordinate with
	    other industry consortia and standards organizations, he says.

			      <strong>Apache Software Foundation: <em>Geir Magnusson</em><br>
			      </strong>Geir Magnussson is a director at Apache and vice president of both the Geronimo 
				  Project and Java Community Project. "We've seen a continuing trend towards openness,
		              enabling the open-source community to participate fully in the process by allowing 
					  open-source implementations of the specifications produced by the JCP," Magnusson said. He said
		              Apache has helped lead these efforts with software such as Apache Tomcat, Apache Axis, 
					  Apache Geronimo, Apache Pluto and other projects that implement JSRs. <br>
		              &nbsp;<br>
		              Involvement in the EC helps ensure continued innovation and growth of the &quot;Java 
					  ecosystem,&quot; he said. "Wide participation of the community in the process ensures the health and relevance
	          of Java, preserving and 
	          growing the investments we make learning and using the technology," he said. 
			  <br>&nbsp;<br>
	          He said Apache supports open-source (and closed-source) implementations of specifications 
			  that can be created during the spec creation progress to provide real-world feedback
	                              to the expert group. "Generally
	          speaking, users are some of the best QA you can have," Magnusson said. "They do things 
			  to software that creators never imagined, or have needs never imagined." He credits the
	          changes of JCP 2.6 with increasing the transparency of the spec creation process giving 
			  users more participation and opportunity for feedback. 
			  <br>&nbsp;<br>
	    The future? &quot;I see that we'll have open-source implementations of the three 
		'platform versions' of Java - J2EE, J2SE and J2ME," he said. "J2EE has already been achieved." He
	          said he expects the trend towards more openness will continue. &quot;Previously, 
			  we've been concerned with a licensing and testing regime dedicated to 'protecting the castle' to ensure compatibility
            - we have achieved that and can now dedicate more energy to ensuring innovation and progress with Java technology&quot;

	          approval of all specs, and new requirements that earlier drafts be made
	          public as examples of improvements that have been made to the JCP
	          Process over the course of the JCP's history. Wayne believes the JCP
	          should continue to evolve towards more openness and more democracy in
	          decision making. For example, the TCK is so central to JCP Specs that
	          details of the TCK License should be known as a JSR starts so all
	          implementers know whether they will be able to license the TCK.
	          Growing pains and all, the JCP has been responsive to the community,
	          producing a wide variety of high quality specifications, he says. &quot;The
	          ability to create new core specs like JSR 166 Concurrency Utilities and,
	          at the same time, to be open to creative, new ideas like JSR 241 Groovy
	          shows a very good, healthy attitude in the JCP program.&quot;
				      <br>&nbsp;<br>
				Carr says it is an exciting time for new technologies in Java specs as
	          the new features in J2SE 5.0 like generics and annotations open up new
	          possibilities throughout Java. &quot; All the Java platforms will reap the
	          benefits of these core language changes over the coming years as
	          benefits move up into J2EE and down into J2ME&quot;, he says.

	          and to market," Fleury says. Look for JCP to speed up and be more aggressive in the
	          technologies it standardizes, he says. 
			  <br>&nbsp;<br>                                          
		      Fleury says that .NET has introduced some good
			features such as the possibility to do tag driven development. 
			"We have responded in the Java camp with the introduction of Java5 and its
	          support for tags," he says. "And by accelerating the JCP process we can put the
	          specs back in the driving seat by at least standardizing faster the
	          innovation that happens out there."
	          
				<br>&nbsp;<br>
				In the future he sees more and smaller specifications, service by
	          services in order to have shorter cycles and faster timet to market for
	          standardized innovation. For example specs should be 50 pages max, standardizing one
	          service as opposed to the current &quot;bible&quot; format, Fleury says. Also the client side of the specification, the models of &quot;rich, thin clients&quot; is going to be increasingly important,
	          he says.

				    <strong>Nortel: <em>Bill Bourne</em></strong>  
					<br>
					Bill Bourne has spent most of his 25 years in the software and telecommunications 
					industry with Nortel. Bill is a solutions architect and manager in the Architecture
	                            group of the Converged OAM Development organization which is responsible 
								for all element and network management products for Nortel's Carrier product portfolio. He says
					that Nortel has embraced Java technology for use in telecommunications related products, 
					and is an enthusiastic supporter of open, collaborative work through the JCP. 
					<br>&nbsp;<br>
                            Bournel says that balancing the need to increase support for an open source culture 
			   while making sure that Java technologies and specifications don't "fork" 
			   into multiple incompatible
	          versions is a key issue, along with promoting the adoption of JSRs, and seeing them have 
			  greater impact on the general industry. "Since I'm in the telecommunications industry, 
			  I'd point to the
	          JAIN/SLEE and OSS/J JSRs as examples," he says. "These JSRs have seen some adoption 
			  but have a long way to go."
		      <br>&nbsp;<br>
	          He says Nortel would also like to offer our expertise in telecommunications architecture 
			  and systems to encourage and guide the evolution of telecommunications related architectures and APIs for
	          such things as Service Logic Execution, Call Control, Management, Services Control, 
			  access to standard protocols like H.248, SIP, etc, network security, and APIs used 
			  between applications in the converged
	          network.
