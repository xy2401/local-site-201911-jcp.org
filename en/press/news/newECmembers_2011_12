		&nbsp;<br>	

As the Java Community Process (JCP) Executive Committee (EC) prepares to enter the next phase of revising the JCP program, the community is more acutely aware of the composition of the EC. Thus, the recent election of new representatives to the Java Platform Standard Edition/Enterprise Edition (SE/EE) EC and the Java Platform Micro Edition (ME) EC carried a somewhat greater sense of importance. 
<br><br>
<div class="header2">SE/EE EC Elected New Members</div>

Multiple candidates vied for the elected seats, driving up anticipation over the outcome. On the SE/EE EC side, two out of nine candidates were elected. Twitter, Inc. captured the lion?s share with 32 percent of the votes, and Azul Systems received 19 percent.

<b>Twitter</b> is new to the JCP community, but well known as one of the hottest social networking enterprises. The company is relying heavily on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) as its runtime and writing new software in Java or Scala. Twitter wants to share open source solutions being developed to solve challenging design problems. The company is developing libraries for scalable IO, monitoring, and management. <a href="http://jcp.org/en/press/news/ec-feature_SE#szegedi">Attila Szegedi</a> represents Twitter on the EC. He is a software engineer in Twitter's Runtime Systems division, serving as the cross-team expert for JVM topics in general, and specializing in JVM performance optimizations and multi-language development. He also contributed to Kiji, Twitter's server-optimized Ruby runtime, maintained Mozilla Rhino, a JavaScript runtime for the JVM, and authored <i>Dynalink: the Dynamic Linker Framework for Languages on the JVM</i>. Attila says, ?We were honestly and pleasantly surprised at the proportion of votes we got. This shows that Twitter as a brand name has a lot of goodwill within the Java community, and we'll do our best to live up to that trust. We joined the SE/EE EC at an exciting time, when it and the ME EC are merging. For now, we are participating in the discussion and work related to the merge.? Attila also keeps an eye on what's happening with JSRs relevant to Twitter, ready to inform colleagues about in-progress ones that could benefit from Twitter?s chiming in.

<b>Azul Systems</b> is also new to the EC, but has been a Java licensee and JCP community member since 2002. Global 2000 enterprises run mission-critical Java workloads on Azul?s JVM and Java Virtualization products. The company demonstrated expertise in design and optimization of systems stack components for Java execution, including OS, virtualization, hardware, and the Java runtime (JVM). Azul signed the OpenJDK Community TCK License Agreement (OCTLA) with Oracle in order to take an active role in the JDK project. Azul?s goal is to actively participate in proposing, reviewing, and ratifying Java Specification Requests (JSRs), and to help set the future direction of the JCP program and JSR technologies. Azul?s representative, <a href="http://jcp.org/en/press/news/ec-feature_SE#tene">Gil Tene</a>, is CTO and co-founder at Azul Systems, which he started with the goal of eliminating common Java responsiveness, performance, and scale barriers. At Azul, Gil pioneered several Java industry firsts in its products, including Pauseless Garbage Collection, Elastic Memory, and Java Virtualization, and has been awarded 24 patents in computer-related technologies. About the SE/EE EC election, Gil says, ?It is telling that both elected seats are from relatively young companies that have recently announced focus on OpenJDK activity. Along with Attila Szegedi from Twitter, I hope to bring some startup/young company energy into the process.? He looks forward to actively helping the JCP.next process move forward, noting that ?community members need a clear and long term path defined for how technology standardization and TCK access rules work.?
