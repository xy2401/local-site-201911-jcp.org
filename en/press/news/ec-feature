<!-- README

Beware: the previous version of this file was very confusing and very fragile. It used nested tables
and transparent gifs for layout. I've simplified it drastically.

To add a new entry please follow the existing format. First, add a new row to the highest-level table
(this will contain the entry.)

There are two "header blocks" of code (everything from the <tr> to the start of the actual bio text) 
that may be used for a bio entry: one for the primary rep and one for the alternate (if we choose to 
list the alternate here.) They are different. 

Copy an instance of the appropriate block and change the member's name (and affiliation,) 
the "name =" and "id =" tags, and the name of the appropriate picture file. 

Then enter the bio text (using only <br /> tags for "paragraphs" and don't forget to close 
the <td> and <tr> tags.

Have fun.

	There he has worked on porting work and optimising virtual machines, most recently OpenJDK, often 
	under the auspices of Linaro. Prior to this he worked in the IBM Java Technology Centre with the 
	JVM on various Linux platforms and other projects such as JSR-326. He has worked with Java since 
	1996 during his degree course at the University of Strathclyde. Along he has used Java on probably
	eight different instruction sets, and so believes the principle of write-once-run-anywhere 
	remains important.
