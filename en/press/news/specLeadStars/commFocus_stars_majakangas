Jaana Majakangas is one of the newest Spec Leads to be named a Star. 
A senior design engineer with a master's degree in Mathematics and a 
minor in Computer Science from University of Jyvaskyla, Finland, 
Jaana has been employed at Nokia Corporation for nine years. While 
there, she has pursued all sorts of software projects related to 
telephony, from the telephone exchange to the mobile Java 
environment. She has written up requirements, use cases, new designs, 
actual code, and tests. More recently, she has participated in 
standardization projects.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
Early in 2002, Jaana began utilizing Java technology in terms of 
developing, project leading, and using Java products. She started in 
the Java EE space, developing server-side components. After changing 
jobs inside Nokia, she began working in the Technology Platforms unit 
on Java ME standardization.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
Jaana began participating in the JCP program in September 2003, 
quickly getting involved with Expert Groups:

<br>&nbsp;<br>
<li><a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.218.html"><strong>JSR 218</strong> </a>Member of  Connected Device Configuration (CDC) 1.1</li>
<li> <a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.219.html"><strong>JSR 219</strong></a> Member of Foundation Profile 1.1</li>
<li><a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.257.html"><strong>JSR 257</strong></a> Spec Lead for Contactless Communication API</li>
<li><a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.27.html"><strong>JSR 271</strong></a> Member of Mobile Information Device Profile 3</li>

<br>
<div class="header3">Reliance on Face-to-Face Meetings</div>
Many Expert Groups rely on email or conference calls to discuss 
issues. However, in Jaana's group, most of the discussion for JSR 257 
has been achieved in face-to-face meetings. &quot;We are dealing with a 
very complex issue, and it is much easier to talk about it when you 
are able to make drawings and make sure that all members are talking 
about the same issue,&quot; she says.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
Each meeting was arranged and hosted by a different member company, 
who provided the facility for the event. Some members have found it 
easier to participate in the meetings than others, but Jaana says, &quot;I 
think that those members that have wanted to participate have managed 
always to do that.&quot; The location is determined by member request, and 
the most active members are located in Europe, so all meetings have 
taken place there. Non-European members are welcome to call into the 
meeting to hear the latest issues right away. So far, the Expert 
Group has had four &quot;really useful and productive&quot; meetings, run by 
Jaana with the help of the organizing member.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
<div class="header3">Strong Leader Required</div>
For the Expert Group to operate efficiently and successfully, Jaana
believes a leader who asserts overall responsibility for the project 
is required. She says, &quot;I think our JSR has progressed mainly due to 
my own targets for the project, and this has forced EG members to 
participate in the effort as well. But we have been working really 
good as a team. We have been progressing the whole time, even though 
we are late from our original schedule.&quot;

<br>&nbsp;<br>
Schedule delays are about as predictable as bad weather, so it's more 
important to know why the delay was caused and whether it affects the 
final ship date. In the case of JSR 257, &quot;external issues&quot; caused the 
delay, which is Jaana's tactful way of noting that her API is built 
on top of a standard that is still in development, and her Expert 
Group must wait until that foundation is complete. Still, Jaana feels 
that the final release will be pretty much on schedule.
If the final release is indeed delayed, Jaana will update the 
published schedule because she knows the importance of communicating 
both the good news and the bad. She says, &quot;I have tried to keep the 
PMO aware of our progress. I have also given 'warnings' about 
upcoming reviews. In all, the communication with the PMO has worked 
well.&quot;

<br>&nbsp;<br>
If the final release is indeed delayed, Jaana will update the 
published schedule because she knows the importance of communicating 
both the good news and the bad. She says, "I have tried to keep the 
PMO aware of our progress. I have also given 'warnings' about 
upcoming reviews. In all, the communication with the PMO has worked 
well."

<br>&nbsp;<br>
For regular communication, the Expert Group mainly uses email, 
although they also arranged several teleconference calls in addition 
to the face-to-face meetings. Jaana actively tries to keep the Expert 
Group aware of the current status of the specification. If concerns 
are voiced from any sector, she tries to address them right away. All 
comments received through the comments alias or from the Expert Group 
member companies are shared with the Expert Group, for example.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
<div class="header3">Deeply Satisfying Role</div>
Jaana was surprised to be selected as Star Spec Lead so soon, since
this is her first time to serve as a Spec Lead and the specification 
is not yet finished. She attributes part of her success to excellent 
mentors, saying, &quot;I have had a good influence on the work from my two
Star Spec Lead colleagues Kimmo and Jere,&quot; who also are employed by 
Nokia.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
Even before achieving Star status, Jaana found the work deeply 
satisfying. &quot;I like my current role where we create a standard in 
some area, and it is interesting to see how it is then implemented in 
actual products. This gives us feedback on how we have succeeded,&quot; 
she says.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
Finland is Jaana's home, where she is raising two sons. She finds 
that being a mother takes up nearly all her free time. She enjoys 
almost all kinds of handcrafts, including knitting and stained glass.
