Volker Bauche works as  a Senior Staff Engineer for Sun Microsystems. Until last year he was a senior software technologist and team lead in a software technology department of Siemens Mobile, later BenQ Mobile. 
Personally, he resides in Munich, Germany, where he likes to read, watch sci-fi movies and Star Trek episodes, 
and hike in the not-too-distant Alps. Married for 20 years, he spends as much time as possible with his wife and 
teenage daughter.

        </tr>
      </table>Professionally, Volker stays on the cutting edge, currently focusing on predevelopment projects, 
evaluations, prototypes, and so forth, which often incorporate Java technology. He also leads product
 development projects from time to time, which usually relate to Java technology. He earned a master's
 degree in mathematics, with a specialty in informatics, a topic he dearly loves. Years ago, Volker was 
employed at a research institute, where he worked on artificial intelligence, participating in a LISP 
implementation.<br>
&nbsp;<br clear=all>
<div class="header3">Exposure to Java Technology and the JCP Program</div>
Before Volker first attended a Java technology crash course for C++ programmers on a developer
 conference in Germany in 1997, he was a C++ specialist who had only read about Java technology. 
Since those early days, Volker has explored Java inside and out as a user, developer, project lead,
 trainer (for Java technology novices as well as more experienced users), and specification lead.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
After he was promoted to software technologist at Siemens Mobile in 1998, he became 
aware of the JCP program when his boss, Calinel Pasteanu, involved his employees in the Expert Group's original 
work on the Java Platform, Micro Edition standardization process. Volker developed internal prototype
 implementations of J2ME. He also created the first internal LCDUI implementation (graphics library in the Mobile 
Information Device Profile) at Siemens Mobile, and implemented an alternative graphics library that was under 
discussion during the MIDP 1.0 Expert Group work. As a Java technology trainer and off the clock, Volker 
devoted some time to exploring the Standard Edition and Enterprise Edition as well.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Volker's involvement in the JCP program increased gradually,
and he vaguely recalls  attending some <a href="/en/jsr/detail?id=118">JSR
118 MIDP 2.0</a> Expert Group meetings as Calinel's
substitute. Volker's own membership in an Expert  Group
probably began with <a href="/en/jsr/detail?id=179">JSR
179 Location API for J2ME</a> in 2002, and
continued for <a href="/en/jsr/detail?id=238">JSR 238
Mobile Internationalization API</a>, <a href="/en/jsr/detail?id=256">JSR
256  Mobile Sensor API</a>, and <a href="/en/jsr/detail?id=257">JSR
257 Contactless Communication API</a>. Volker
also served as co-Spec Lead with Jari L&auml;nsi&ouml; of
Nokia on <a href="/en/jsr/detail?id=195">JSR
195 Information Module Profile (IMP)</a> and <a href="/en/jsr/detail?id=228">JSR
228 IMP - Next Generation</a>. Later he co-specleaded <a href="/en/jsr/detail?id=281">JSR 281 IMS Services API</a> together with Ericsson AB.
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="header3">Efficiency and Morale-Boosting</div>
As Spec Lead, Volker likes to kick off new Expert Groups with a two-day face-to-face (F2F) meeting. 
He prepares carefully beforehand since time is short and members who traveled long distances want to 
work efficiently. In order to establish common ground, Jari and Volker would meet together to discuss 
concerns and hammer out a united position a day or two before presenting it at the larger group meeting. 
At the F2F, Volker prefers to open up free discussion as long as there is effective moderation and a specific agenda.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
From then on, the team works through intensive email discussions, followed up by occasional phone conferences. 
Documents are shared using the Expert Group's private homepage. Timing is a critical factor for keeping the 
dialogue going at a productive pace. Volker says, &quot;It is very important to respond quickly to everybody 
involved in standardization work. I always try to answer concerns out of the Expert Group on the same day that 
I receive them.&quot;
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Volker also interacts rapidly with the PMO, primarily through email, such as when following up on 
formalities such as applying for each review stage, requesting information necessary to start an early 
draft review (EDR), or getting the proper version of the license agreement. He always asks Liz Kiener to 
send him the &quot;very helpful&quot; checklist for planning a new milestone. Email is great for day-to-day 
interactions with the PMO, but Volker never misses an opportunity to personally visit PMO events during the
 JavaOne conferences he attends. Moreover, he has taken advantage several times of the Spec Lead training 
performed in Munich by Liz, &quot;always a pleasure and very helpful.&quot; Volker found the PMO facilities
 &quot;a really big help&quot; for publishing the results of the Expert Group work.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Volker makes it a priority to respond to requests quickly. However, he slows the pace somewhat when responding 
to concerns expressed by the EC.
He says, &quot;Because the EC is often concerned with the specification itself, and the EC members want a 
comprehensive and clear statement (not necessarily one that agrees) to be satisfied, one has to discuss the 
issue in the Expert Group, which causes some organizational overhead.
  Because it is a virtual team, after all, the answer can take some days, but it must not be longer. 
Sometimes it is difficult, because concerns often come up very shortly before the ballot ends.&quot;
<br>&nbsp;<br>According to Volker, the Spec Lead should lead in a way that helps the project, the team, 
and the individual members. For the best interests of the project, the Spec Lead will maintain the JSR 
progress and drive the schedule forward, especially when unexpected changes impact the timeline. In order 
to fuel the team's performance, the Spec Lead should choose the most efficient forum for Expert Group 
discussion, whether that is email, phone, or F2F conferences. He should make sure that everybody stays 
informed since frustrated experts don't participate efficiently and remember that some experts work for
 competing companies and therefore may be reluctant to express their thoughts. A Spec Lead should also 
be considerate of individual members by communicating that he and his contribution are vitally important 
for the progress of the standard. It's also helpful to include small talk in emails, keeping members' 
local holidays in mind, not only because it's useful to know when a person is out of reach, but also 
because those days have a special meaning for that member.<br>

<div class="header3">Co-Spec Leadership</div>
Although Volker and Jari represented competing corporations, their partnership in co-Spec Leading worked well. 
Such a partnership means an additional decision-making iteration in that a Spec Lead should discuss ideas and
 decisions with the partner before emailing the Expert Group.
  However, that extra step can improve the original idea or reveal that it was not so great after all. Volker 
appreciated having a partner for practical reasons as well. &quot;Managing my absences -- due to business 
trips, vacation, holidays -- was easy in my case. Because I had a co-Spec Lead, I was always able to redirect
 questions from every side during my absence, and it always worked fine.&quot; Volker's experiences with Jari
 were &quot;absolutely positive. You have to trust your co-Spec Lead, and he has to trust you. I think we were
 the perfect complement to each other.&quot;
