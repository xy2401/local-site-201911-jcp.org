Over his career, Pierre Gauthier has been involved in the design and development of software for telecommunications and operation support systems (OSS). He is currently a software architect and senior member of technical staff with Metasolv Software. Before joining Metasolv, Pierre was a project manager and software architect for Nortel Networks' Service Provider CTO office. He was also Nortel Networks' specification prime for the OMG Corba Notification Service. He holds a master's degree in Electrical Engineering from the &Eacute;cole Polytechnique in Montr&eacute;al, Canada.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
Pierre has been involved in the JCP program for over five years, but his role within it is best understood in the context of his overarching dedication to the OSS through Java (OSS/J) Initiative. Organized by fifteen JCP member companies in 2000, the OSS/J Initiative uses the JCP infrastructure to bring technologies based on Java Enterprise Edition (EE) to the OSS market, and Pierre is a tireless and well-recognized champion of that cause.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
It's not an exaggeration to say that Pierre's influence has substantially impacted every <a href="/en/jsr/tech.listBy=3&listByType=tech">OSS/J API</a>, but he was particularly involved with these JSRs:

<br>&nbsp;<br>
    <li><a href="/en/jsr/detail.id=91"><strong>JSR 91</strong></a> Spec Lead for OSS Trouble Ticket API</li>
    <li><a href="/en/jsr/detail.id=142"><strong>JSR 142</strong></a> Spec Lead for OSS Inventory API</li>
    <li><a href="/en/jsr/detail.id=144"><strong>JSR 144</strong></a> Expert for OSS Common API</li>
	
    <br>
   <div class="header3">Chair of the OSS/J Architecture Board</div>
In the early days of OSS/J, there was no formal 
  Architecture Board or chief architect, but Pierre 
  acted as the de facto leader. After the OSS/J 
  Architecture Board was formalized into a 
  technical advisory committee to promote the 
  vision and goals of the Initiative, Pierre was 
  unanimously elected as its chair. In this role, 
  he has led the establishment of a strong 
  technical and architectural foundation for all 
  OSS/J APIs. This foundation is widely recognized 
  as the strongest contribution that OSS/J has 
  produced so far.<br>&nbsp;<br>
     
<div class="header3">Editor of the OSS/J Design Guidelines</div>
As Chair of the Architecture Board, Pierre 
  sponsors and contributes directly to the 
  investigation and development of key technical 
  strategies around emerging technologies and 
  architectural directions. In this context, Pierre 
  also serves as the editor for the OSS/J Design 
  Guidelines, a set of design patterns and best 
  practices for the specification of Java EE, 
  Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), and Extensible Markup 
  Language (XML) interfaces for Telecommunication 
  Management in OSS/J. These guidelines served as 
  the basis for JSR 144 OSS Common API and are used 
  across all thirteen of the OSS/J APIs. Although 
  the development of the Design Guidelines is a 
  collaborative effort, those in the know say that 
  Pierre's expertise and ability to innovate is 
  largely responsible for the scope and excellent 
  quality of the guidelines.<br>&nbsp;<br>
     
  <div class="header3">Spec Lead and Implementation Team Lead</div>
JSR 91 OSS Trouble Ticket API was the very first
  API started by the OSS/J Initiative. At the time,
  the Service Commerce unit of Nortel saw this as 
  an opportunity to shape the technical direction 
  of OSS/J by becoming the Spec Lead for this first 
  API. Of particular strategic importance to the 
  Service Commerce unit was the need to have OSS/J
  recognize XML as a key enabling technology for 
  the development of telecom management APIs.
  
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Pierre was the natural choice for this role. He 
  had expertise in the Service Assurance space. He 
  had several years of experience with distributed 
  software architectures. At that time, moreover, 
  his focus was on the development of best 
  practices in the use of Java EE and XML 
  technologies. As Spec Lead, Pierre created a 
  number of models, templates, and patterns that 
  had a deep influence on all the other OSS/J APIs 
  that followed. In this role, Pierre collaborated 
  with other Spec Leads and technical contributors 
  to set the overall technical direction of OSS/J.
  
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Pierre has led a number of implementation teams 
  over the past few years. He makes sure that the 
  work is divided in small, clearly understandable 
  deliverables with specific owners. He led the 
  team responsible for the implementation of the 
  OSS/J Trouble Ticket API, and he is currently 
  leading the team responsible for the 
  implementation of the OSS/J Inventory API.
  
<br>&nbsp;<br>
He also contributes directly to these 
  deliverables; often by prototyping the most 
  technically challenging components himself as a 
  way to manage and control risks. For example, 
  Pierre recently investigated the Java Data 
  Objects (JDO) technology. Although his 
  conclusions and recommendations were for the 
  OSS/J Inventory API Reference Implementation 
  (RI), he prepared a presentation on JDO to share 
  with various design teams and is now moving to 
  EJB 3.0 based prototypes.<br>&nbsp;<br>
     
  <div class="header3">Networking and Promoting OSS/J</div>
Pierre continues to position OSS/J as a thought 
  leader in the industry, speaking at conferences 
  and seminars. He excels at presenting complex 
  technical overviews in an easily understood way.
  His ability to provide the details of the thought 
  process that led to the technical decisions made 
  by OSS/J coupled with his clear presentation of
  the issues in the context of emerging 
  technologies and architectures typically wins 
  over the audience.
  
<br>&nbsp;<br>
OSS/J seminars have featured a number of 
  technical presentations by Pierre. These seminars 
  have been and still are being held in different 
  locations to raise awareness and promote 
  adoption. He has also presented papers at 
  multiple JavaOne conferences, partly because 
  JavaOne has more of a focus on implementers. 
  Exposing implementers to the high caliber of work 
  being done in OSS/J helps build awareness and 
  appreciation in people who can influence adoption 
  at the grassroots level.
  
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Pierre gets around, keeping in touch with whoever 
  has the expertise or influence he needs. He 
  helped establish XML messaging on the Java 
  Messaging Service (JMS) as the de facto 
  Enterprise Application Integration paradigm 
  across OSS components. By working with 
  distinguished thinkers within Sun -- such as 
  Rahul Sharma, Spec Lead for 
  <a href="/en/jsr/detail.id=16"><strong>JSR16</strong></a> Java EE Connector Architecture and
  <a href="/en/jsr/detail.id=101"><strong>JSR 101</strong></a> Java APIs for XML (JAX) based RPC, and Mark Hapner, Spec Lead for 
  <a href="/en/jsr/detail.id=109"><strong>JSR 109</strong></a> Implementing Enterprise Web Services and 
  <a href="/en/jsr/detail.id=159"><strong>JSR 159</strong></a> Java Process Component API, Pierre also 
  helped the OSS industry formulate the OSS/J Web 
  Services strategy.<br>

  <div class="header3">Mentor to Colleagues</div>
One major distinctive among Star Spec Leads is 
  that many of them have made the effort to mentor 
  others to take on increasing levels of 
  responsibility within an Expert Group. Pierre has 
  mentored numerous individuals over the past few 
  years. He carefully estimates how much help his 
  colleagues actually require, and he calibrates 
  his involvement in such a way that his co-workers 
  are able to learn and become self-sufficient over 
  time.<br>&nbsp;<br>
     
  <div class="header3">Time for Fun</div>
Pierre lives on the Quebec side of the Outaouais
    River, near Ottawa, the beautiful capital of 
    Canada. It's a great place for Pierre to raise 
    and play with his 12-year-old kid and walk his 
    dog in the Gatineau hills near his house. For 
    more outdoorsy fun, he bikes, skis, and kayaks. 
    He enjoys life indoors, too, avidly reading 
    philosophy, science, and history, and listening 
    to jazz, classical, and indie music.
