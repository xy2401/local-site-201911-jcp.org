      </table>Having worked with Java technology in all phases, from
development to adoption and promotion, Vince fully
appreciates its ease of use. He says, &quot;I have a lot of programmatic language experience -- 
from assembly language for real time and embedded systems to C++ for telecom applications -- and Java 
technology is the first language that merges all the domains when computer science is involved.&quot;
<br clear=all>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="header3">Ongoing Interest in Three Java Technologies</div>
Vince started his career as a real-time kernel software
and network application developer, and later worked
at Hewlett Packard in the Advanced Intelligent Network
domain. By October  1996, he had joined Sun Microsystems'
Telecom Management Network team. Two years later he
got involved with the JCP program as an observer of
one of the earliest Java Specification Requests, the
<a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.3.html">JSR 3 Java  Management
Extensions (JMX) Specification</a>.
He helped develop and  later became the technical lead
of JDMK (Java Dynamic Management Kit), Sun's implementation
of JMX. He stays involved in the creation of this network
management technology by participating as an observer
of the JMX  technology JSRs. <a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.70.html">JSR
70</a>,
  <a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.71.html">71</a>, <a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.146.html">146</a>, 
  <a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.160.html">160</a>, <a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.255.html">JSR
  255</a> 
and <a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.262.html">262</a>.
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In the telecommunications space, Vince created an early
draft of the <a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.11.html">JSR
  11</a> JAIN
  TCAP Specification, based on the initiative he launched
  with three other Sun Microsystems fellows. Vince
  also came up with the first demonstration system
  of JAIN for Supercomm 98. His interest  continues
  through his deep involvement in the <a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.18.html">JSR
  18</a> JAIN
  OAM API  Specification.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
A founding father of the OSS (Operations Support System)
through Java (OSS/J) initiative, Vince is the Spec
Lead for  JSR 144 OSS Common API. This API factorizes
all the commonalities and patterns that emerge across
the entire OSS/J  API portfolio, which requires his
expertise to serve all other <a href="/en/jsr/tech.listBy.3.listByType.tech.html">OSS
  technology JSRs</a>. See also the <a href="/en/press/success/OSS">OSS
  Success Story</a>.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Vince says, &quot;As all the OSS JSRs inherit from JSR 144, I provide support and help to the
 Expert Groups regarding usage and leveraging of JSR 144.
  I also help make sure the design follows the OSS/J design guidelines related to the OSS API's specification 
and definition.&quot; He plays the innovative role of &quot;proxy,&quot; or administrative buffer between the 
PMO and the Spec Leads of each and every OSS/J API. In this role, he ensures the consistency of all OSS 
deliverables and handles administrative tasks, such as submission, on behalf of the Spec Lead to allow the 
Spec Lead and the Expert Group to focus more on developing the API itself.
  Although JSR 144 is in a maintenance phase and experts are no longer directly involved, 
the OSS/J architectural group within the OSS/J initiative is still actively evolving OSS/J design guidelines.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Vince's commitment to these three technologies remains firm. He says, &quot;Between JDMK/JMX, JAIN, 
and OSS/J, I increasingly took more and more responsibilities in these projects. And I continue to work in the 
development, design, architecture, evangelization, and support of those Java technologies.&quot;

<br>&nbsp;<br>
<div class="header3">Communication Carries the Momentum</div>
Communication with the Expert Group is one of the most important Spec Lead responsibilities, 
Vince feels. Because his JSR 144 experts are scattered world-wide, they don't often get together in the same 
location. However, Vince knows that these meetings are important when they do happen. &quot;My experience 
demonstrates that Face 2 Face is the most productive manner to progress, although difficult to organize these 
last four years due to travel cost reductions and travel bans. Therefore, we leverage as much as possible the 
developers and OSS industry conferences to meet in person,&quot; he says. In a JSR's early stage, the goals 
and objectives are spelled out and acknowledged by all experts in the group. To continue the Expert Group's 
momentum, he relies on weekly conference calls, using web tools like <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/">http://www.timeanddate.com</a> to synchronize participants. Every meeting includes an agenda and minutes, and all of the JSR's &quot;mature&quot; material is posted on a private project on java.net.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Vince points to three essential communication ingredients for starting, quickly progressing,
 and achieving consensus between experts: having a clearly identified goal, leveraging existing standards 
such as 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), and recruiting the &quot;top-gun&quot;
  experts in the industry domain whose company's substantial commitment to the OSS/J initiative backs them up. 
He says, &quot;The decision process is always based on consensus, and I've never had to force a decision.&quot; 
As Spec Lead, Vince attends to the daily challenge of motivating experts to stay focused and support each other
 in all of the tasks they voluntarily take on.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
For keeping the communication open, Vince finds the community page useful, except in not permitting information 
and documents to be classified, organized, or tracked by version. Back in 1998, Vince says experts focused on 
the spec document only, addressing the Reference Implementation (RI) and Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) only
 much later. Now, however, especially when JSRs inherit design guidelines or common components, an Expert Group 
often creates the spec, RI, and TCK in parallel. Vince observes that private project pages on java.net do better 
to address expert needs at all stages of a JSR, and all OSS JSRs now have or soon will have private and public 
pages on java.net.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Because of his current proxy role, Vince stays in direct contact with the PMO, handling administrative 
tasks on behalf all the OSS technology Spec Leads. He says, &quot;The PMO folks are all very reactive and supportive. 
They always provide the exact and accurate information. And it is always a real pleasure to be in touch with them. 
Having the PMO handle all the specification versions was one of the best achievements of the JCP program as it 
simplifies the intermediate phases a lot.&quot;
  Vince has received very few notes of concern from the EC, probably because he is so highly experienced 
in dealing with the JCP program that he addresses administrative concerns before they become an issue.

<div class="header3">Best Practices Don't Reinvent the Wheel</div>
We're all in this together, so Vince's engineering attitude is to solve the 
problem and share it to the extent that he can. For example, to spare others from what Vince 
calls &quot;specifier's block&quot; -- the fear of writing that comes when starting with a blank 
page -- the OSS/J initiative came up with templates for typical documents (spec, design guides, 
installation guides, and so forth) and environments for joint development. These templates, which 
have already been forwarded to the PMO, are available for free to all who are interested in joining 
or contributing to the OSS/J initiative. They not only help writers to focus on the main points rather
 than the blank page, but they also give all OSS-related specifications a similar look and feel, making
 it easier for readers to navigate the structured content.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Foundational specifications can also save work for future Spec Leads.
  The OSS design guidelines and JSR 144 together address the generic integration issues that an 
OSS Expert Group might have. Using JSR 144 as a baseline, an Expert Group can focus only on the 
domain's specific issues. Similarly, the licensing and working model is the same for all OSS/J 
JSRs: provided free of charge, in source code for the RI, and in binary for the TCK. All are available
 on java.net in similarly structured build and deployment environments.

<div class="header3">Star Spec Lead Is Touched</div>
Vince says, &quot;Working on OSS/J is by far the most enriching experience in my professional
 life. It is a privilege to work everyday with some of the best telecommunications experts in the world. And
 what many people would consider as a human challenge, quickly turned for me into a fantastic journey along 
which I made friends that I admire, and who I hope do care about me. But OSS/J gets all of us so busy and 
focused that there is no time to dream about awards. When I was told that I was chosen by my peer Java 
developers as a JCP Star Spec Lead, I was really taken by surprise and deeply moved. I was only hoping to 
get the respect of my OSS/J fellows. So being distinguished by the Java community at large was like reaching
 the summit of the mountains that surround my house after a 10-hour hike, to see the sunset over the Alps -- a 
warm feeling of accomplishment. I sincerely hope my personal experience will help other Spec Leads move the Java 
platform to even greater success.&quot;
<br>&nbsp;<br>
In addition to hiking the countryside, Vince bikes, skis, and plays the geometrically challenging
 game of snooker (billiards). He has renovated nearly his entire house in France as a do-it-yourself project.
