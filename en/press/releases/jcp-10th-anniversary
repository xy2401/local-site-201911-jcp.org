<div class="header1">THE JCP(sm) PROGRAM CELEBRATES JAVA(TM) TECHNOLOGY'S 10TH ANNIVERSARY WITH RECORD RESULTS</div>
<br>

<p class="h3">Continues To Score High Marks with Developers for JCP 2.6 Enhancements,
Sets New Record of Innovations, Witnesses Rise in Global Membership</p>

<b>SANTA CLARA, CA, June 22, 2005</b> - - The Java Community Process(sm)
(JCP sm) Program Management Office (PMO) and Executive Committees today
announced strong results on multiple fronts.  On the process side, one
year after launch, JCP 2.6 program gets members' appreciation for the
developer-friendly changes it introduced.  On the innovation front, the
JCP program further builds on its reputation of developing quality,
open standards-based Java Specification Requests (JSRs).  Record number
of JSRs with strong impact in key industries including wireless, tools,
JAIN(TM) technology and OSS systems, web services and enterprise
technologies are finalized or nearing completion.  On the membership
side, the JCP program is seeing growing interest from developers all
over the world to join the program and become part of the Java binary
standard development process.
<br>
<br>

"That we have great results to report today across the board is a credit
to us all", said Onno Kluyt, Chairman, JCP.  "We believed in Java
technology's power to build a community dedicated to platform
development through open-standards, we consistently acted on our
beliefs, we made it happen.  Not only does the JCP set a standard for
technology with compatibility and conformance, it also sets a standard
for collaboration and sharing in the industry.  We welcome all those
who share this belief to join the forum."
<br>
<br>

<b>JCP 2.6.  Program - Spec Leads, Expert Groups Take Advantage of
Enhanced Transparency, Participation and Efficiency</b>
<br>
<br>

JCP 2.6 program builds on the strong foundation laid by JCP 2.5 program
which provisioned for the ability to create compatible, independent
implementations of Java specifications and expanded the licensing
choices to include open-source.  The 2.6 enhancements give earlier
access to draft specifications to a broader group of Java technology
developers and add more value at each level of participation.  This has
made it easier and more rewarding for developers to get involved in
the Java standards definition process.  Spec leads experienced early on
with these process enhancements for example JSR 166, Concurrency
Utilities, leveraged the new channels of early involvement by
developers in order to improve final deliverables.  Another example is
JSR 270, Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE(TM) platform) 6.0
("Mustang") Release Contents which uses a highly transparent JSR
development style made possible by the changes brought by JCP 2.6
program and JSR 247, Data Mining 2.0 driven by Oracle Corporation.
<br>
<br>

"JCP 2.6 is the most transparent and accessible iteration in the
program's evolution to date", said Scott Stark, CTO, JBoss, Inc.  "It has
substantially improved and enriched the developer experience and
broadened access to JSR information by encouraging participation from
Java developers at every level."
<br>
<br>


<b>Innovations Record Set - Key Standards Get Finalized, New Proposals
Enter The Process At A Healthy Clip</b>
<br>
<br>

The latest innovation track record of the JCP program includes:  in the
enterprise space, three versions of Java Enterprise Edition; in the
desktop space, three versions of the Java Standard Edition; in the
wireless space, three versions of Java Micro Edition; in the web
services space, multiple Java API interfaces for XML standards; for
vertical industries, OSS and JAIN APIs.  Since January 2004 to date 39
new projects were approved to be developed as JSRs through the JCP
program.  In May alone six JSRs moved into Final Approval Ballot and
two into Final Release.  In June seven JSRs are moving into Final
Release among them key JSRs like Java Business Integration (JBI), JSR
208.  Driven by Sun and an Expert Group of over 22 industry vendors and
individuals including The Apache Software Foundation, JBoss, IONA,
Novell, Oracle, SAP, SeeBeyond, Sonic Software, Sybase, TIBCO Software,
and webMethods, this specification extends Java Enterprise Edition with
a protocol infrastructure supporting the range of integration component
models and the range of bindings required by standards-based service
oriented architectures (SOA).
<br>
<br>

Other JSRs expected to advance into final stages or complete
development in June are XML Digital Signature APIs, JSR 105, co-led by
Sun and IBM; Content Repository for Java Technology API, JSR 170,
developed by Day Software; Content Handler API, JSR 211, spearheaded by
Sun; Personal Profile 1.1, JSR 216, Connected Device Configuration
(CDC) 1.1, JSR 218, Foundation Profile 1.1, JSR 219, from Sun; Web
Services Metadata, JSR 181, from BEA Systems; Payment API, JSR 229,
from Siemens AG.
<br>
<br>

<b>Membership on the Rise - JCP's Globalization as Standards Body Continues</b>
<br>
<br>

Currently the JCP has 912 members, a 12 percent increase from last
year's numbers.  This rise is representative of a steady upward trend
in membership.  Individual developers, corporations, universities,
governments, and open source groups continue to be attracted to the
JCP.  They see opportunity for all in its value proposition of
maintaining the Java technology binary standard through community
driven innovations and of driving the creation of compatible
implementations the industry can trust.
<br>
<br>

Among the newest members is SouJava, the largest Brazilian Java Users
Group (JUG).  They joined the JCP early this year as a society which
includes Java technology users and Java technology evangelists from
Brazil whose objectives are to strengthen, expand and professionalize
the use of Java technology in the country.  With SouJava now a member
of the community, the global reach of the JCP program expands
considerably.
<br>
<br>


IT industry leaders from countries like China have already announced
their intention to join the community and are expected to finalize the
process in the coming months.  Indian based Tata Elxsi, provider of
customized design solutions to companies across the globe, recently
became a JCP member.  In the Americas, Serpro, a Brazilian government
contractor, just announced their intention to join the JCP program.
<br>
<br>


To find out more about its record results meet with the JCP program at 
the 2005 JavaOne conference 
<a href="/en/press/news/2005JavaOne/2005JavaOneTeaser">http://jcp.org/en/press/news/2005JavaOne/2005JavaOneTeaser</a>.
The community will participate in events among them the Java Communities In 
Action Event where the winners of the 2005 JCP Program Awards will be 
announced

<b>About the Java Community Process</b><br>
Since its introduction in 1998 as the open, inclusive process to develop and revise Java technology specifications, reference implementations, and technology compatibility kits, the Java Community Process program has fostered the evolution of the Java platform in cooperation with the international Java developer community. The JCP has over 900 company and individual participants; more than 275 Java technology specifications are in development in the JCP program out of which 45% are in final stages.
