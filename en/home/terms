Terms of Use ("Terms") apply to everyone who Uses this Site (as defined below)
except, if you are party to a current, in-force Java Specification
Participation Agreement with Oracle (JSPA), then these Terms do not apply to
activities that
are within the subject matter of such JSPA. In addition, these Terms do not

OR MATERIALS, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THE TERMS AND AGREE TO THEM.
IF YOU ARE AGREEING TO THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL

made available under license through web pages that are linked to these Terms.
No modification to the terms will be binding, unless authorized by the Host in
writing or as provided in Section 5.d above. Any express waiver or failure to
exercise any right under the Terms will not create a continuing waiver
or any expectation of non-enforcement. If any provision of the Terms is held

provision will be replaced with an enforceable provision that accomplishes the
original business purpose, and the other provisions of the Terms will remain in
full force and effect. Paragraph headings and captions are for convenience only
and are not be to be considered in determining the meaning or effect of these
Terms. Rights and obligations under these Terms other than provisions that
authorize You to Use or access the Site or Materials will remain in effect
