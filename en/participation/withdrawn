<h2>JSRs: Java Specification Requests</h2>

<h1>JSRs by Technology</h1>
</p>

<div class="anybar"><img src="/images/global/bar_green.gif" alt="" width="12" height="4"></div>

The following Java<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> Specification Requests (JSRs) have been withdrawn
from the Java Community Process<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">SM</FONT></SUP> Program
for the reasons stated.</P>

<p>
<b>PLEASE NOTE</b>: These JSRs represent proposed
specifications that were either not started or not completed. Those
that were started, but not completed, are usually being completed
elsewhere. See below for details. Note that a Java Specification Request may have been <a href="/aboutJava/communityprocess/accepted.html">Accepted</a> from the <a href="/procedures/jcp2/#1.3">JSR Approval Ballot</a> but withdrawn later.
</p>

<UL TYPE="CIRCLE">

<LI><A href="/jsr/detail/2.jsp">JSR-000002 Boundary-Scan API</A>
<BR><BR>
Withdrawn 1999.01.09 at the request of the submitter.
<BR><BR>

<LI><a href="/en/jsr/detail.id=7">JSR-000007 Industrial Automation Extension</a><BR><BR>
Withdrawn 2004.10.11 with the consent of the Spec Lead. Difficulties in forming
an expert group and reaching consensus toward a draft spec hampered the JSR's abilities in successfully navigating the community process.
<BR><BR>

<LI><A href="/jsr/detail/8.jsp">JSR-000008 Open Services Gateway Specification</a>

<BR><BR>
Withdrawn 1999.11.16 because work moved to Open Services Gateway consortium
(<a href="http://www.osgi.org">www.osgi.org</a>) where the specification
will be completed.
<BR><BR>

<LI><a href="/en/jsr/detail.id=17">JSR-000017 JAIN<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> ISUP Specification</a><P>
Withdrawn 2003.02.05. The Spec Lead of this JSR approached other members of
 the Expert
Group to see if they might be interested in taking on the role of
Spec Lead, but there has been no interest. This is due to the
fact that industry focus has evolved/changed, and as such the
original scope of the JSR is not as important to the industry as
originally scoped. The Spec Lead has since left the JCP and the Expert Group has been disbanded.
</LI>
<P>

<LI><a href="/jsr/detail/25.jsp">JSR-000025 JAIN Connectivity Management</a>
<BR><BR>
Withdrawn 2000.11.21 at the request of the submitter.
<BR><BR>

<LI><a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=26">JSR-000026 UML/EJB Mapping Specification</a><BR><BR>
Withdrawn 2004.03.29 due to lack of interest after the original Spec Lead company was acquired. New Spec Lead company has failed to find a Spec Lead who wants to drive JSR-26 to completion. Expert Group was informed of intent to withdraw JSR-26 and it supported that action.<BR><BR>

<LI><A href="/jsr/detail/27.jsp">JSR-000027 Java Cryptography Extension 1.3</A>
<BR><BR>
Withdrawn 1999.11.05 before work began because it describes a cryptographic system and/or a
crytpographic framework whose implementation would be subject to
U.S. Export Licensing requirements.
<BR><BR>

<LI><a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=29">JSR-000029 JAIN<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> MAP Specification</a><BR><BR>
Withdrawn 2003.05.30 due to Spec Lead's move to another company and the lack of
interest from the rest of the Expert Group in driving the spec to Final Release. At the time it was withdrawn, there had been no activity in the JSR since September 2001.<BR><BR>

<LI><A href="/jsr/detail/33.jsp">JSR-000033 InfoBus 2.0 Specification</A>

<LI><A href="/jsr/detail/42.jsp">JSR-000042 Travel Industry Reservation Booking
Foundation API Specification</A>
<BR><BR>
Withdrawn 2000.06.13 at the request of the submitter.  Community support
was not sufficient to form an expert group.
<BR><BR>

<LI><a href="/jsr/detail/44.jsp">JSR-000044 Braille API Specification</a>
<BR><BR>
Withdrawn 2000.11.21 at the request of the submitter.
Community support was not sufficient to support an Expert Group.
<BR><BR>

<LI><a href="/en/jsr/summary.id=49">JSR-000049 Web Based Industrial Monitoring Framework</a><P>
Withdrawn 2010.02.18 as Spec Lead left the JCP and no other Expert Group member was willing to take over as Spec Lead.<P>

<LI><a href="/en/jsr/detail.id=61">JSR-000061 Phonelets API Specification</a><P>Withdrawn 2004.04.09 at the request of the Spec Lead after 4 years with no Expert Group.
<BR><BR>

<LI><a href="/jsr/detail/64.jsp">JSR-000064 Financial Services Party Component</a>
<BR><BR>
Withdrawn 2000.08.30 at the request of the submitter.
XML party components for this functionality are being developed
under the Customer Profile Exchange (CPex).
<BR><BR>

<LI><a href="/jsr/detail/65.jsp">JSR-000065 Concise Object-Array Literals</a><BR><BR>
Withdrawn 2003.07.25 at the request of the Spec Lead with the agreement of the Expert Group. The community requirements targeted in this JSR are now being addressed as part of autoboxing in <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=201">JSR

<LI><A href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=70">JSR-000070 IIOP Protocol Adapter for JMX<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> Specification</a><P>
Withdrawn 2003.10.23 following re-prioritization within the company, IONA could
no longer commit the resources necessary to complete the specification and build an RI and TCK. In addition, IONA no longer sees a sufficient customer demand for access to JMX MBeans using CORBA clients, so IONA formed the opinion that the
specification did not address a common need in the marketplace and therefore was unnecessary.<BR><BR>

<LI><A href="/jsr/detail/71.jsp">JSR-000071 JMX-TMN Specification</a><BR><BR>

<LI><a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=74">JSR-000074 Public Key Crypotography Standards (PKCS) 1.0</a><P>

<LI><a href="/jsr/detail/81.jsp">JSR-000081 JAIN<sup><Font size="-2">TM</font></sup>
 H323</a><P>
Due to the general absence of interest in the Community, the Specification Lead
decided to withdraw the JSR from development.</LI>
<P>

<LI><a href="en/jsr/detail?id=83">JSR-000083 Multiarray package</a><P>
Withdrawn 2005.09.06. JSR-83 has shown slow
progress for several years and has not generated significant industry
interest or participation. With no outlook for a timely completion of this
JSR, the Spec Lead decided to withdraw it.</LI>
<P>

<LI><a href="/en/jsr/detail.id=84">JSR-000084 Floating Point Extensions</a><P>
Withdrawn 2002.03.01. Due to the general absence of interest in the community, the Specification lead withdrew the JSR.</LI>
<P>

<LI><a href="/en/jsr/detail.id=92">JSR-000092 Localizable Text</a><P>
Withdrawn 2005.02.08. The Spec Lead provided the following explanation: "Both JSR-92 and JSR-150 address the issue of "distributed
internationalization" in the J2EE world. JSR-92 is somewhat client-centric
in nature while JSR-150 attempts to provide a server-side solution. The
progress of JSR-92 is rather slow, and some of the issues raised in JSR-92
can be addressed more elegantly by the technology advocated in JSR-150. The
existence of two separate JSRs for the same issue of distributed
internationalization can generate unnecessary confusion. Hence we feel
JSR-92 should be withdrawn from the JSR space altogether. We will
incorporate relevant portions of JSR-92 in JSR-150."</LI>

<LI><A href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=126">JSR-000126 Distributed Page Assembly</a><P>
Withdrawn 2003.11.10. Initial discussions for the JSR 126 EG were deferred when
they realized that a viable solution in the proposed direction, which is complimentary to JSR 128, required advancements in the underlying technology (Edge Side Includes). At the time, it seemed that discussion about ESI-related standards were sufficiently active that they could wait for the next version of the standard. However, those discussions seemed to stall as attentions were directed to early adoption and other topics. If ESI standards are revised at a later date, then perhaps the objectives of JSR 126 could be pursued through a new JSR.<P>

Withdrawn 2003.07.09. The Spec Lead has chosen to withdraw this JSR. It was determined that the needs of games developers were best served by moving to a pure open source model for game client technologies. This changes in strategy will allow the broadest participation by the game development community, and will focus
the energies of the community on timely solutions that address a rapidly changing technology landscape. The Spec Lead wishes to thank the Java Community and the Game Developers who supported and showed interest in this effort.</LI>

Withdrawn on 2008.08.05: Web services security (WS-Security) has become the defacto standard to secure web services messages. Lack of a standard in Java to write to these APIs, hasn't caused any interoperability or integration issues across vendor platforms. So, this JSR is being withdrawn.</LI><P>

<LI><a href="/en/jsr/detail.id=189">JSR-000189 Java<font size="-2"><sup>TM</sup></font> 3D API 1.4</a><P>
Withdrawn on 2005.11.08: The changes to the Java 3D API as originally envisioned by JSR-189 were
quite significant, and were planned as part of a major API release, for
which we had planned to form an expert group under the JSR. Due to
changes in the nature of the project development, this effort was
discontinued nearly three years ago, a few months after the JSR was
filed. JSR-189 was left open as a place-holder, but it no longer makes
sense to leave it open.
<P>

The Java 3D API is now a community source project on java.net, where all
new development has happened over the past 18 months. We are actively
developing the 1.4 API release with help from the Java 3D community on
java.net. This release is a much more modest undertaking than was
originally planned, and all new API changes are being designed with
public input. As such we are closing this JSR, and are doing Java 3D 1.4
as a maintenance release under the JCP.
