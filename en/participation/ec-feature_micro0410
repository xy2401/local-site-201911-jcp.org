		  IBM, as the world&rsquo;s largest information technology company, has been a 
            substantial contributor to the Java Community for a decade. IBM is 
            represented in Java ME by David Girle, a senior software developer who 
            has been involved in various Java technology projects since 1998, 
            including most recently the development lead for SyncML4J, a 
            synchronization framework written in the Java language. &quot;IBM is heavily 
            investing in the success of Java technology - In the Java ME space, IBM 
            provides VM ports to more than 20 environments, together with support 
            for a broad range of configuration, profiles and JSRs&quot; Girle says. He 
            says IBM&rsquo;s representatives, whether leading or participating in Expert 
            Groups and Executive Committees, will continue to use their expertise 
            and technical resources to make contributions for the betterment of the
            Java Community and to help guide the Java platforms&rsquo; evolution and 
            development.<br>

          Nokia is represented by Pentti Savolainen, who brings a record of 
            experience in software R&amp;D, sales and corporate collaborations. Nokia 
            has been an active member of the ME EC since its establishment. &quot;Our 
            goal is to develop the JCP program toward more open standards organization while 
            maintaining its effectiveness, and increasing Java technology 
            competitiveness and acceptability,&quot; said Savolainen, who heads the Nokia 
            team that has responsibilities for terminal Java API related 
            standardization, industry cooperation and preparation of JCP standards 
            for implementation into Nokia terminals. He said Nokia expects to 
            continue aiding the JCP program effort by promoting such goals. 
          <br>
&nbsp;<br>In addition to 
            the EC work, Nokia is also a very strong contributor in the practical 
            Java Specification Request (JSR) Expert Groups (EG), currently leading 17 Java ME related JSRs adding 
            new functionality to Java technology, Savolainen noted. Even if Java 
            technology has gained some significant wins in some areas, such as 
            downloadable games for Java enabled mobile terminals - Java and the JCP 
            faces many challenges to stay competitive, he said. Those challenges 
            include reducing fragmentation of the technology, a need for speed and 
            innovation, and better architectural solutions, to mention some, 
            Savolainen says. &quot;To speed Java technology development and innovation 
            the JCP needs to open up and find ways to better enable quick endorsement of 
            development from outside JCP as well,&quot; he says. Java ME technology also 
            needs new architectures to address future challenges and allowing for
            creation of wider selection of different applications and compelling 
            services by the developers and the industry.

          Philips became interested in the JCP program as Java technology was 
            built into a number of its products and became a JCP program member in 2000.            
          <br>&nbsp;<br>
Royal Philips Electronics is now one of the world's biggest electronics 
            companies and Europe's largest. Jon Piesing's breadth of understanding of Java 
            technology issues -- technical, business, and licensing -- in general 
            and of Philips' products in particular make him an ideal representative.

says the most important issues facing the JCP program are structural 
            rather than technical. He says the process is too &quot;bottom-up,&quot; and needs 
            more structure. &quot;One significant issue is the excessive cumulative cost 
            of TCKs for all the individual JSRs,&quot; he says. &quot;While it would be very 
            helpful for the executive committee to address this, it seems costs are 
            hard to discuss while remaining within the limits of what is allowed by 
            anti-trust law.&quot; 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>An issue that might be easier to address is providing 
  greater transparency into the progress and schedules of expert groups, 
  he says. This would help those whose main interest is the (future) 
  existence of a JSR for a particular feature rather than the details of 
  its contents, Piesing says. In the future he said he expects the process 
  will become more transparent to non-members of expert groups. He said 
  that the most likely technology advance in Java ME is the ability to 
  reliably run multiple applications/MIDLets/Xlets at the same time 
  including killing one of them without interrupting the others. &quot;This 
  won't directly
  help application developers but it would be a positive improvement to 
  the end-user experience,&quot; Piesing said.

		  Symbian has a long history of active participation in the JCP program and JSR 
		    specification development for the mobile Java standards and their 
		    implementation into smartphones. We spoke with Stuart John who at the 
		    time of the interview was Symbian's representative on the ME EC. Stuart
		    notes that  ten years ago his team &quot;was flat out at work on the genesis 
		    of what would eventually be known as v1 of Symbian OS: a 32-bit 
		    operating system targeted at PDAs and advanced mobile phones.&quot; It didn't 
		    take long for news of Java to take hold, and he adds that collaborative 
		    work with Sun began in 1997. &quot;Since then, more than 50 million Symbian 
		    OS mobile phones have shipped containing Java technology&rdquo;, he specifies. 
		  <br>
		  &nbsp;<br>John says participation in specification development provides early 
		    visibility of the building blocks for future applications and helps 
		    reduce fragmentation in the existing platform. He says that the most 
		    pressing high-level matter facing the mobile IT industry may be dealing 
		    with complexity. &quot;To appeal to mainstream end users, the devices have to 
		    hide all this complexity, providing a veneer of simplicity that appears 
		    to anticipate users' needs,&quot; John says. &quot;Get the design wrong, and the 
			complexity spills out, confusing and frustrating users.&quot; To keep a lid 
		    on the demons of complexity, the mobile IT industry needs to keep in 
		    mind the injunction to &quot;cooperate before competing.&quot; John says there is 
		    little point in companies gaining a few additional percentiles in what 
		    is still a relatively small market - it's far better to grow this market 
		    to its greater potential. 
		  <br>&nbsp;<br>Over the next few years, smart mobile devices 
		    will dramatically increase their value for entertainment, education, and 
		    enterprise purposes alike, he says. &quot;They'll help their users to keep in 
		    touch with the conversation, issues, and information that's important to 
		    them,&quot; John says. &quot;They'll integrate more and more of the functionality 
		    that presently requires many separate objects.&quot; Each such integration 
		    provides the possibilities for new &quot;killer applications&quot; in the 
		    intersection of functionality that used to be separate, he says. These 
		    devices will build on the power of the mobile phone phenomenon to 
		    provide &quot;always on&quot; social computers. &quot;Java APIs to this new 
		    functionality will be crucial to allowing novel services to appear in 
		    quick response to newly identified user needs,&quot; John said.

		  Sony Ericsson has taken an active role in the ME Executive Committee and    
		    has been working to ensure an open, well-managed community since joining    
		    the EC in 2002. Sony's representative, Hanz Hager, is the Java Product    
		    Manager in charge of product strategy, planning, requirements, and    
		    execution, and he oversees all inbound licensing of Java technology for    
		    Sony Ericsson. He's been involved in all projects that embed Java    
		    technology into Sony Ericsson handsets. He marvels at how, from its    
		    modest beginnings, &quot;the J2ME marketplace is becoming the largest    
		    installed base of developer platforms with almost 1 billion units.&quot;		    
		  <br>&nbsp;<br>One of the most important issues facing the executive committee is    
		    fragmentation in the wireless industry, Hager says. &quot;It has been    
		    discussed a lot lately,&quot; Hager says. &quot;Everyone has their view of how    
		    fragmented it is and what the problems are. In my view the Java    
		    ecosystem for mobile devices is not very fragmented any more, but we are    
		    starting to see a new type of fragmentation when different carriers    
		    start setting different rules for their markets.&quot; This will make it hard    
		    to work globally for small players and this will most likely kill some    
		    of those efforts, he warns. 
		  <br>&nbsp;<br>Looking to the future, Hager says it is very    
		    clear that there is a desire to have a more flexible Java technolgoy stack in    
		    mobile devices. &quot;CLDC has been found a bit to restrictive for that,&quot; he    
		    says. &quot;Therefore we will see bigger and bigger importance of CDC based    
		    solutions.&quot;More and more systems will also have the capability to    
		    execute multiple applications simultaneously, Hager says, and backwards    
		    compatibility with MIDP/CLDC will continue to be important.</td>
