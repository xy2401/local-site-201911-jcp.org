			<p>On the Monday before the JavaOne Conference official opening, 20 JCP members came from Russia, India, New Zealand, 
			and other places for training. The training led by <a href="en/press/pmo/pmo_profiles/commFocusPMO-kiener">Liz Kiener</a> 
			of the Program Management Office (PMO) targets new or potential Spec Leads who want to learn how to guide a Java 
			Specification Request (JSR) through the ins and outs of the JCP program. Chief technology officers, chief 
			scientists, managers, program managers, and others participated in the training to discover what was new or 
			how they could help the Experts and Spec Leads they oversee. 
			  <br />
			  &nbsp;<br />			
			The training session introduced the <a href="/en/introduction/glossary">PMO jargon</a>, conventions, protocols, common errors, 
			and understood niceties associated with the process of creating and guiding a JSR. One of the more useful tidbits that Spec 
			Leads aspiring to Star status learned is that as long as they keep the PMO informed and the schedule on their community page 
			updated, a JSR is considered &quot;on time.&quot;</p>

			<p>Schedules may be more aggressive now. Because last year's update to version 2.6 of the JCP program required Expert 
			Groups to operate more transparently and to submit EDRs earlier in the process, JSRs are zipping through the process 
			twice as fast as they did under previous versions of the program. Graham Hamilton, VP and fellow on the Java platform 
			team at Sun Microsystems, and JCP SE/EE Executive Committee representative as well as other JavaOne speakers noted that
			 the revised process is also having the intended effect of gaining more and better feedback from the JCP community, 
			 producing higher quality specifications.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
			  Community communication matters, and <a href="en/press/pmo/pmo_profiles/commFocusPMO-ulescu">Corina Ulescu</a>, the 
			  public relations manager for the PMO, suggested several ways to tap into the program&rsquo;s resources to promote 
			  JSRs. Putting to work new PR technologies including blogs, podcasts, Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds, and wikis 
			  can certainly help this effort. &quot;A PR person can connect you to the right beat reporter, assist with informing
			   press about JSRs and other JCP program news and updates of importance to Java developers. Communicating about a JSR 
			   is part of that standard&rsquo;s success and Spec Leads&rsquo; success is the Java community's success,&quot; she 
			   commented during a presentation to Spec Leads at the JCP Training Session. <br />
            </p>
			<div class="header2">Educate JavaOne Attendees</div>
Each year, JCP members submit proposals for JavaOne talks, anticipating the opportunity to educate developers about the scope, 
purpose, and usage of Java technology based standards they have helped develop. As a result, key JSRs were discussed at the 
JavaOne conference in general sessions, birds-of-a-feather sessions (BOFs), classes, and at the Sun Microsystems booth in the Pavilion.

            Conference attendees were called to action to join the JCP Program by Sun CEO Jonathan Schwartz who in his Conference 
			opening keynote referred to the unique opportunity developers have to be part of a thriving community that is tightly 
			connected to Java technology's present and, very important to its future. Conference participants dropped by the JCP 
			pod in steady numbers to check out the program that generated so much buzz. JCP members stopped to say hello and check 
			out a prototype of the upgraded jcp.org website to be launched this summer. JCP members are pleased with the practical 
			features such as support for international character sets and RSS feeds for each JSR. Discussions of JSRs will be 
			posted and organized by threads to minimize the duplication of questions and suggestions. Better tools will automate 
			many of the Expert Group maintenance and communication chores and enable collaboration on working drafts. Senior 
			software developer Hamid Ben Makels represents Fujitsu Ltd. on the Executive Committee (EC), and he looks forward to 
			the website improvements, which will make it easier to monitor the status of JSRs.

            Any streamlining of the workload is welcomed by Spec Leads, who expend copious amounts of time and energy launching and 
			guiding the development and revision of JSR Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), Technology Compatibility Kits (TCKs),
			 and Reference Implementations (RIs). These men and women are essential to the success of the JCP program. Their unique blend
			  of technical know-how, logical thought process, clear communication, solid work ethic, creativity, patience, good humor, 
			  and decisiveness enable Spec Leads to get things done in a timely manner.

              No one knows the overall worth of a Spec Lead better than the PMO staff, who twice each year selects Star Spec Leads 
			  to commend as role models. The newest <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/press/news/specLeadStars/commFocus_stars_burns">
			  Star Spec Leads</a> stand out because of the excellence, timeliness, and transparency of their technical output,
			   their willingness to update the PMO on their progress or any schedule slips, and an outstanding reputation among 
			   Experts in their group and the EC. They are: </p>
            <ul>
            <li> Ed Burns, a technologist at Sun Microsystems, and the co-Spec Lead of JSR 127, JavaServer Faces, and JSR 252, JavaServer Faces 1.2. <br />
            </li>
            <li> Jose Cronembold, a senior development manager at Oracle, and the Spec Lead for JSR 198, A Standard Extension API for Integrated Development Environments. <br />
            </li>
            <li> Asko Komsi, director of industry relations in technology platforms for Nokia, and co-Spec Lead of JSR 248, Mobile Service Architecture 
			(MSA), which was nominated Most Innovative Java ME JSR for 2006, and JSR 249, MSA Advanced. Asko was also nominated as Outstanding Java ME 
			Spec Lead for 2006. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Heather VanCura, manager of the JCP Program Office, introduced the three at an exclusive Tuesday evening cocktail reception held on the 
		  33rd floor of the Argent Hotel. All Spec Leads were invited as thanks for their hard work within the community. Besides catering to their 
		  appetite with a meal of roast beef, substantial hors d'oeuvres, and cocktails, the occasion granted something even more valuable -- 
		  an opportunity to converse with each other, EC members, the PMO, and the press. </p>
          <div class="header2">Play and Party with Award Winners</div>
          The JCP community's event-of-the-year took place at the Argent Hotel, under a large, white tent on the garden patio. About 300 JCP members 
		  and curious onlookers helped themselves to a sumptuous assortment of upscale happy hour appetizers and an open bar, accompanied by jazzy 
		  tunes. All guests received a SIM card reader that backs up mobile phone data. A few lucky people were chosen to compete for bigger prizes. 
		  After answering a full battery of Java trivia questions, Juliana Furbringer won an MP3 player/recorder watch, and Kai T&ouml;dter took home 
		  a wireless USB mouse. <br />
          <br />
          Nudged forward by Jonathan Schwartz's Monday challenge, Eric Mielke has decided he wants to help the JCP effort by commenting on drafts. 
		  A Web developer at Kansas State University, Eric believes JCP development is &quot;core to what is going on.&quot; <br />
          <br />
          David Berry, CTO of Synchronoss Technologies, also joined the party to consider getting involved. He had been following the JSRs that 
		  support the Operations Support Systems through Java (OSS/J) initiatives. The fact that competing companies work together in the 
		  JCP program appeals to him. In fact, 75 distinct organizations lead JSRs.
          
		  <br />&nbsp;<br />
		  
		  
		  Some people brought their issues. Charles Hemphill of Conversay, a speech technology company, 
		  was concerned about fragmentation in the mobile market. Thor Henning Hetland, who leads JavaBen, 
		  the Norwegian Java User Group (JUG), felt the JCP is growing in transparency, but is still too vendor-oriented. 
		  Qusay M. Mahmoud, Associate Professor at the University of Guelph, would prefer Spec Leads post 
		  their Specs, RIs, and TCKs simultaneously to allow more complete reviews.<br />&nbsp;<br />

            The party moved into full swing as conversations rumbled, pictures were taken with Duke, and piles of food disappeared. 
			Meanwhile, a trio of screens announced current JCP statistics, the newest Star Spec Leads, and the 2006 JCP award nominees. 
			But the biggest moment of the night was the announcement of the winners of the 
			<a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/press/news/awards/2006award_winners">2006 JCP Program Annual Awards</a>, who were given
			 a marble pen holder plaque with a crystal abstraction of Duke. </p>
          <ul>

          One of the most gratifying sights at the JavaOne Conference came from walking the 
		  Pavilion floor and seeing the numerous vendors who have already implemented JSRs 
		  in their mapping tools, phones, and many other devices. One can only imagine the 
		  boom in development that can occur now that the major Java platform technologies 
		  (Java EE, Java SE) have been simplified for ease of use. Stay tuned for JavaOne 
		  2007. The best is yet to come.<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br />&nbsp;<br />
