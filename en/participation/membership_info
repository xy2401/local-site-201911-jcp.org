Now that you are a JCP Member, what do you do next? What can you do, and what do you need to do? 
<P>

See the sections below to find out what you can do and what your responsibilities are. What you can do varies based on which type of Membership you have.
<P>
<a href="#AM">Associate Member</a> | <a href="#PM">Partner Member</a> | <a href="#FM">Full Member</a><P>

<HR>
<P>

<a name="AM"></a><P>
<div class="header2">Associate Membership Information</div><P>
As an Associate Member, you can be listed as a Contributor on JSRs and vote for Associate seats in the annual Executive Committee elections:<P>

<u>Contributor</u>: As an Associate Member, you can nominate yourself to be listed as a Contributor to a JSR. You've probably already been submitting feedback or ideas to one or more JSRs that you have in mind, but you can also always look at the <a href="/en/jsr/all">list of all JSRs</a> to find a JSR to which you'd like to contribute.<P>

<u>EC Elections</u>: Every year in late August/early September, you will receive information via e-mail on the upcoming Executive Committee Elections process. This information will include a log in and web site URL for casting votes and reading elections updates. As as Associate Member, you can cast votes for the Associate seats on the Executive Committee.  
<P>

<U>Responsibilities</u>: You will be contacted periodically for issues affecting your Membership. Each year the PMO contacts each Member at least twice: for the renewal of the Membership, and for the annual Executive Committee elections. 
<P>
You are also responsible for maintaining your profile, ensuring that it contains your current contact information. 
<P>

<B>Canceling your Membership</b>: You may, at any time, choose to cancel your JCP Membership. When you cancel, keep the following in mind:
<ul>
<li>Canceling will immediately remove your listing as a Contributor on any active, non-final JSRs.
<li>Any JSRs to which you Contributed that produced a Final Release will still have a record of your past participation.
<li>You will lose the ability to vote in the annual JCP Executive Committee Election.
<li>You will no longer be listed as an Associate Member.
</ul>

To cancel, simply notify the PMO via e-mail to admin<faketag></faketag>&#64;jcp.org that you wish to cancel your JCP Membership. The above consequences will come into play immediately.

<P>
<HR><P>
<a name="PM"></a>
<div class="header2">Partner Membership Information</div><P>

As a Partner Member, you and your organization may serve on the Executive Committee and vote in the annual EC Elections. One Member Representative will be listed as the Primary Contact with the PMO.<P>

<B>Maintaining your JCP Membership</b><P>

Each JCP Member has one person who is listed as that Member's "Primary Contact" to the JCP. The Primary Contact is the person within your organization who is responsible for the maintenance of your JCP Partner Membership. This usually takes three forms: Membership renewal, maintaining the list of your Member's representatives, and voting in the annual Executive Committee elections.<P>

<u>EC Elections</u>: Every year in late August/early September, you will receive information via e-mail on the upcoming Executive Committee Elections process. This information will include a log in and web site URL for submitting nominations to the EC, casting votes, and reading elections updates. As as Partner Member, you can cast votes for the Ratified and Elected seats on the Executive Committee.  
<P>

<u>Membership renewal</u>: The legal agreement that you or your organization signed to become a JCP Member - the Partner Membership Agreement (PMA) - automatically renews every year. As the Primary Contact, you will receive e-mail updates concerning this renewal each year around the month that you and your organization signed the PMA.<P>

If you do not want to renew, please respond to the renewal e-mail message with your decision to cancel the agreement. See "Canceling Membership," below.<P>

<u>List of Member Representatives</u>: You and any other representative of your Partner Membership may review the list of Member Representatives for your organization by selecting "My Profile" in the left nav and then clicking the "View Membership Info" link. The Primary Contact must also review and approve/decline new representatives who request to be associated with your Membership.

<P>
<ul>
	<LI>Approving Member association requests - As new users register for the site, some of them may be legitimate members of your organization. They may submit a request to be associated to your Membership. When this happens, an e-mail message is sent to your Member's Primary Contact, asking for the Primary Contact's approval. If the Primary Contact wishes to add the person as a representative of the organization, the Primary Contact will send a message to the PMO (admin<faketag></faketag>&#64;jcp.org explicitly approving the addition. If the PMO does not get that message, the person will not be added as a representative of your Membership.<P>
</ul>

<B>Canceling your Membership</b>: You may, at any time, choose to cancel your JCP Membership. When you cancel, keep the following in mind:
<ul>
	<li>Canceling will immediately remove all of your representatives from all Executive Committee Expert Groups, if any. Please make sure that your representatives are aware of this.
	<li>Canceling will remove your organization from the Executive Committee, if you had a seat in that body.
	<li>You will lose the ability to participate in the Executive Committee election.
        <LI>You will no longer be listed as a Partner Member.
</ul>

To cancel, simply notify the PMO via e-mail to admin<faketag></faketag>&#64;jcp.org that you wish to cancel your JCP Membership. The above consequences will come into play immediately.

<P>
<HR>
<P>

<a name="FM"></a><P>
<div class="header2">Full Membership Information</div><P>

As a JCP Full Member, you and your organization may <a href="/en/jsr/proposal">propose new JSRs</a>, may lead JSRs, may <a href="/en/jsr/egnom">serve on Expert Groups</a>, may be <a href="/en/jsr/egnom">listed as Contributors to a JSR</a>, may serve on the Executive Committee, and may vote in <a href="/en/whatsnew/elections">the annual EC Elections</a>. One Member representative will be listed as the Primary Contact with the PMO.<P>

<B>Maintaining your JCP Membership</b><P>

Each JCP Member has one person who is listed as that Member's "Primary Contact" to the JCP. This person is responsible for the maintenance of the JCP Membership for that Member. This usually takes three forms: Membership renewal, maintaining the list of your Member's representatives, and voting in the annual Executive Committee elections.<P>

If you are a Full Member and an individual, you are also responsible for informing the PMO when your Employer changes.<P>

<u>Membership renewal</u>: The legal agreement that you or your organization signed to become a JCP Member - the Java Specification Participation Agreement (JSPA) - automatically renews every year. As the Primary Contact, you will receive e-mail updates concerning this renewal each year around the month that you or your organization signed the JSPA.<P>

If you do not want to renew, please respond to the renewal e-mail message with your decision to cancel the agreement. See "Canceling Membership", below.<P>

<u>List of Member Representatives</u>: This consists of three parts: approving new representatives who request to be associated with your Membership, maintaining their contact information, and replacing/removing representatives.

<P>
<ul>
<LI>Approving Member association requests - As new users register for the site, some of them may be legitimate employees of your organization. They may submit a request to be associated to your Membership. When this happens, an e-mail message is sent to your Member's Primary Contact, asking for the Primary Contact's approval. If the Primary Contact wishes to add the person as a representative of the organization, he'll send a message to the PMO (admin<faketag></faketag>&#64;jcp.org explicitly approving the addition. If the PMO does not get that message, the person will not be added as a representative of your Membership.<P>



<li>Changing contact information - If you are the Primary Contact to a JCP Member organization, chances are that the contact information for some of your representatives will change over time. One
of your organization's representatives may move to another city, or his/her e-mail address changes. When that happens, you should send mail to admin<faketag></faketag>&#64;jcp.org with the change. Note that representatives on JSR expert groups may also ask their Spec Leads to make this sort of change directly.

<li>Replacing representatives - Replacement of Expert Group members must be reported immediately
     to the Spec Lead and the PMO, providing the new member's name,
     address, phone and fax.   This is an essential action required to
     retain the integrity of the JSR output and timeline.  Your
     compliance is appreciated. Similarly, if an expert should be removed for any reason - two common ones are: job responsibilities changing, or he/she left the company - please notify the PMO immediately of any changes you require.</ul>


<P>
Periodically the PMO may contact you directly when we discover that one of your representatives' contact information may be incorrect (when e-mail messages are bouncing, phone calls reveal a line that's out of service, etc). Please provide current contact information for your representatives when asked, or provide a replacement if the representative may not continue in that role.
<P>
<u>EC Elections</u>: Every year in late August/early September, you will receive information via e-mail on the upcoming Executive Committee Elections process. As the Primary Contact, you will be the one to cast the vote on behalf of the Member you represent. This information will include a log in and web site URL for posting nominations, casting votes, and reading elections updates. As a Full Member, you can cast votes for the Ratified and Elected seats. 
<P>

<B>Canceling your Membership</b>: You may, at any time, choose to cancel your JCP Membership. When you cancel, keep the following in mind:
<ul>
<li>Canceling will immediately remove all of your representatives from all JSR Expert Groups. Please make sure that your representatives are aware of this.
<li>Canceling will cause the immediate withdrawal or Spec Lead change of any JSRs that you currently lead. If no one on your Expert Group wishes to take over the role of Spec Lead, the JSR will be withdrawn. If someone on the Expert Group is willing and able, that Member will take over as Spec Lead for the JSR you had led. If your JSR has already produced a Final Release and thus is in the Maintenance stages of the process, the JSR will become dormant, rather than withdrawn.
<li>Any JSRs in which you or your organization participated that produced a Final Release will still have a record of your past participation.
<li>You will be removed from the Executive Committee, if you are serving on that body.
<li>You will not be able to participate in the EC Elections.
<li>You will be removed from the list of Members.
</ul>

To cancel, simply notify the PMO via e-mail to admin<faketag></faketag>&#64;jcp.org that you wish to cancel your JCP Membership. The above consequences will come into play immediately.
