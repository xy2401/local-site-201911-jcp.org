		  <strong>SAS, Rich Main<font color="#FF0000"><a name="main"></a></font></strong><br>
&nbsp;<br>
		  
		 
		  SAS provides a new generation of business intelligence software and   
		    services that create enterprise intelligence. SAS solutions are used at   
		    about 40,000 sites - including 96 of the top 100 companies on the   
		    FORTUNE Global 500. As a Java platform consumer rather than a platform   
		    provider, SAS understands the challenges and opportunities related to   
		    deploying end-user Java applications in large-scale, enterprise   
		    environments. At SAS, representative Rich Main says the most important   
		    issue facing the executive committee is increasing the transparency of   
		    the JCP program. &quot;Developers are the life blood of the community and information   
		    is the life blood of developer,&quot; Main says. The EC's job is to ensure   
		    that information is being provided in a timely manner so that developers   
		    can best influence and leverage the Java standards. So the JSR expert   
		    groups must operate in as open a manner as possible, providing frequent   
		    status updates and engage the community for input early and often.  <br>
		    &nbsp;<br>  
		   Main   
		    says the most important technology now being considered in the JCP program is   
		    the Java module system (JSR 277). This JSR goes very deep, affecting the   
		    basic classloading semantics of Java. &quot;It will have significant   
		    ramifications for the Java platform and potentially even the Java   
		    language itself,&quot; Main says. &quot;In addition, it proposes to solve   
		    difficult problems regarding the deployment of Java solutions and   
		    ongoing provisioning of updates and maintenance to those solutions.&quot;  
		    The JCP program must react to the accelerated rate of change in the software   
		    world by streamlining the standards process and ensuring that the   
		    efforts are relevant to the needs of the community, Main says. He says   
		    it is essential that strategies are designed to strengthen the   
		    &quot;community&quot; aspect of the Java Community Process. &quot;Like with software   
		    development, there is a &quot;build vs. buy&quot; decision that must be made for   
		    each standards effort as well as a consideration of whether or not a   
		    particular effort is even worth the time and energy,&quot; Main says. &quot;In the   
		    past, the JCP has been of the mindset that we should &quot;let a thousand   
		    flowers bloom&quot;. But, every good gardener knows that you will get better   
		    overall production by prudently thinning the crop along the way.&quot;

			BEA Systems is a leading application infrastructure provider and major   
		    innovator in the Java technology marketplace. BEA's representative, Ed   
		    Cobb, oversees BEA's participation in a variety of standards and open   
		    source organizations and is responsible for BEA's involvement in   
		    technical collaborations with other software companies. Cobb notes that   
		    he joined the company ten years ago. Today he is most amazed at Java   
		    technology's &quot;transition from a client technology to the standard for   
		    new server-side development on the Internet.&quot;. He thinks that Java&rsquo;s   
		    success is predicated on well-defined standards creating a larger   
		    marketplace and enhanced competition. &quot;The JCP is still an important   
		    source of those standards,&quot; Cobb says.   
		   <br>&nbsp;<br>BEA has been a diligent voter in   
		    progressing new JSRs through the process and a significant contributor   
		    to improvements in both the Java Specification Participation Agreement   
		    (JSPA) and the JCP program process document, Cobb said. But he adds the   
		    most important issue now facing the committees is the increased   
		    competition from non-Java alternatives, the rise of open source and the   
		    ability of the JCP program to react to changes like these in the marketplace. In   
		    the future, he sees Metadata-driven programming and non-traditional   
		    programming language becoming more important than procedural languages   
		    like Java. &quot;Interoperability is becoming more important to customers   
		    than portability,&quot; he says.<br><br>

		    As vice president of SAP NetWeaver Standards, Michael Bechauf is   
		    responsible for defining SAP's industry standards strategy. He currently   
		    works as part of the SAP Platform Ecosystem organization, which defines   
		    SAP's platform strategy overall. In 2001, SAP joined the JCP program.   
		    Michael coordinates all standards-related activities of the SAP Platform   
		    Ecosystem, so in 2002 he became SAP's primary representative on the   
		    SE/EE Executive Committee. Bechauf says the EC will help guide Java   
		    technology to become &quot;the foundation for a next generation service   
		    composition platform that can rapidly deliver applications that support   
		    those business processes deemed most critical for a company.&quot;  
		   <br>&nbsp;<br>Bechauf is   
		    dedicated to Web Services and the need to simplify the Java platform and   
		    make it better suited for business application programmers. The JCP must   
		    continue to make Java simpler and easier to use by reducing the number   
		    of technical choices that Java developers face, Bechauf said.   <br>&nbsp;<br>

		    Hani Suleiman, a self-described &quot;keen and passionate Java developer     
		      since 1998,&quot; says openness and transparency are perhaps the biggest     
		      issues facing the JCP program. &quot;For example, spec leads and even individual     
		      experts should not shy away from discussing their work with the     
		      community at large &mdash; provided of course this is done without violating     
		      any contracts!&quot; says Suleiman, who serves on a number of JCP program Expert     
		      Groups, including JSR 220, JSR 244, JSR 245, JSR 250, and JSR 277.     
		      Likewise, the EC itself should be a bit more transparent to both the     
		      community at large and the Expert Groups both in terms of its mission     
		      and its activities, Suleiman says. But looking to the future, he also     
		      says he sees the process becoming more open and transparent, with far     
		      greater participation. And in terms of technology in the Java world, he     
		      sees a big push towards modularization. &quot;The platform is constantly     
		      growing, and there is a significant push towards a more 'a la carte'     
		      approach,&quot; he said. This will probably start manifesting itself for the     
		      Java SE 7 timeline, he added. &quot;I personally also have big hopes for Java     
		      on the desktop, an area which has received a lot of love and attention     
		      for Java SE 6,&quot; Suleiman said.

		   Intel is a leading supplier and innovator of microprocessors and other      
		    silicon building blocks being used in the vast array of devices and      
		    computing platforms where Java technology is being deployed. Intel      
		    representative Wayne Carr has worked on TV set-tops, video conferencing,      
		    operating systems, networking, multimedia and on advanced research in      
		    robotics -- and has been coding in Java technology since the language      
		    was introduced. Carr says that two key issues facing the EC are how to      
		    cooperate more effectively with other standards and open source      
		    organizations and how to ensure a level playing field for independent      
		    implementations of JSRs while retaining Java&rsquo;s important promise of      
		    compatibility.  
		     <br>&nbsp;<br>As an example of the issue of working with other      
		      organizations, JSR 198 and JSR 277 could be viewed as JCP program producing      
		      direct competition for ongoing work in the open source Eclipse      
		      organization, he says. &quot;The Executive Committee needs to look into how      
		      best to coexist and cooperate with other related organizations,&quot; Carr      
		      says. Standards work best where the community can agree on a common      
		      approach for addressing areas where interoperability between competing      
		      implementations is important, he says.  On the subject of independent      
		      implementations, TCKs are a valuable tool in ensuring compatibility, but      
		      often there is insufficient information about what it will cost or what      
		      conditions would be imposed to license the required TCK, Carr says. That      
		      uncertainty can discourage potential implementers (other than the Spec      
		      Lead) from working on JSRs or from producing implementations. &quot;The JCP      
		      needs to explore ways to ensure adequate disclosure of TCK licensing      
		      terms what the licensing requirements are for implementing JCP specs, at      
		      the outset of spec development,&quot; Carr says.		        
		     <br>&nbsp;<br>The growth of Java has been phenomenal and Java is positioned for an      
		      exciting future, Carr says. &quot;Java is taking off in phones, and in      
		      consumer electronics &ndash; for example, DVD players - we may see an      
		      explosion of the use of Java,&quot; he says. Java is strong on servers and      
		      has a whole new opportunity on the desktop in Linux, he adds. Carr also      
		      said that Sun's special role in the JCP program which effectively gives it a      
		      veto over many of the specs (language and platform specs) and over any      
		      process changes should be addressed. &quot;As trust increases on all sides,      
		      we would expect the JCP program to move more towards a more typical standards      
		      organization structure where all members have similar rights and      
		      responsibilities,&quot; Carr said.
