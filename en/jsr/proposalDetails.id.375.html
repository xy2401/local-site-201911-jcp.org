</P>

<H4>2.1 Please describe the proposed Specification:</H4>

<P><p>
The goal of this JSR is to improve the Java EE platform by ensuring the Security API aspect is useful in the modern cloud/PaaS application paradigm. This promotes self-contained application portability across all Java EE servers, and promotes use of modern programming concepts such as expression language, and contexts and dependency injection. This JSR will holistically attempt to simplify, standardize, and modernize the Security API across the platform in areas identified by the community via survey results and submitted JIRA issues.
</p>
<p>
The Security API JSR will enhance the following areas:
</p>
<p>
- User Management -
</p>
<p>
Currently, there is no standardized support for user management in Java EE. Applications have no portable way of creating, deleting, updating, and grouping users within the Java EE platform. Typical workarounds include using third-party libraries or developing in-house solutions, the results of which may be vulnerable and unsecure. 
</p>
<p>
We are proposing a standardized user service, which would enable an application to perform user management operations, such as create, delete, update, and group users. The user service would manipulate users from a user source. We are considering user sources originating from resources such as LDAP, data source, files, embedded, and the server platform.  The user source would be changeable per deployment environment, enabling a different user source for development, test, and production. The user source would typically be scoped to the application, however may be shared across applications by means currently used to share resources (e.g., JNDI lookup). We expect that some user sources would not support all user service operations, so the user service API would support a means to determine the capabilities of the configured user source. 
</p>
<p>
- Password Aliasing -
</p>
<p>
Currently, there is no standardized support for secure password reference and storage in Java EE. Applications may be required to supply passwords in various locations, such as annotations, deployment descriptors, URLs, and files. Typical workarounds include password encryption by third party libraries or plain-text  password storage, which may result in vulnerable, unsecure solutions.
</p>
<p>
We are proposing a standardized syntax for indicating password alias, and a means for resolving the alias to a password value. The password repository would be a secure credentials archive, to be self-contained and deployed with the application. We are considering having the secure credentials archive include other credentials, such as key stores and trust stores.
</p>
<p>
- Role Mapping -
</p>
<p>
Currently, there is no standardized support for role mapping in Java EE. Applications have no portable way of mapping authority roles to users and user groups within the Java EE platform. Typical workarounds include using third-party libraries or developing in-house solutions, the results of which may be vulnerable and unsecure. 
</p>
<p>
We are proposing a standardized role service, which would enable an application to perform role mapping operations, such as granting, revoking, and querying user and group roles. The role service would manipulate mappings from a role mapper. We are considering role mappers which have mappings originating from resources such as LDAP, data source, files, embedded, and the server platform. Also, we are considering a one-to-one group-to-role mapper, which maps groups directly to roles. The role mapper would be changeable per deployment environment, enabling different mappings for development, test, and production. The role mapper would typically be scoped to the application, however may be shared across applications by means currently used to share resources (e.g., JNDI lookup). We expect some role mappers would not support all role service operations, so the role service API would support a means to determine the capabilities of the configured role mapper. 
</p>
<p>
- Authentication -
</p>
<p>
We propose the following three enhancements regarding authentication.
</p>
<p>
We propose a means to enable an application to inform the platform runtime which user service and role service to use, if any. This would be an application-scoped configuration that would bind an application-defined user service reference and an application-defined role service reference, for use by the platform runtime whenever authentication is performed within the application. The configuration would be changeable per deployment environment, enabling different bindings for development, test, and production.
</p>
<p>
We propose a means to enable each servlet to be configured with different authentication methods within a single web application. Currently, Java EE web applications only support one selected authentication method per application. This proposal would enable different servlet-based modules (e.g. JSF and REST) to be configured with different authentication methods within the same application deployment.
</p>
<p>
We are considering adding an API to enable HttpServletRequest.authenticate to operate asynchronously, providing a non-blocking overloaded version with a callback.
</p>
<p>
- Authorization -
</p>
<p>
Currently, Java EE only supports method access decisions by checking the assigned role of the authenticated user. There is no standardized support for incorporating application-domain rules into the authorization decision. Typical workarounds include using third-party libraries or developing in-house solutions, the results of which may be vulnerable and unsecure.
</p>
<p>
We are proposing a new standardized method interceptor annotation, capable of incorporating application-based rules into the method access decision. This interceptor annotation would be invoked like a CDI Interceptor using &#64;AroundInvoke. The rules would have access to the current invocation context, including attributes of the authenticated user. We are considering the rules to be text-based as Java Expression Language (EL), which would include access to managed beans. These EL rules could be embedded as inline text, or referenced from an external resource. We are considering supporting external rule sources, such as LDAP, data source, and file.
</p>
<p> 
Additionally, we are considering supporting standardized CDI Events as part of the access decision. This would enable selected classes declared as invocation observers to make access decisions based on the invocation context.

<P>No.</P>

<H4>2.9 Are there any security issues that cannot be addressed by the current security model?</H4>

<P>See 2.1 above.
</P>

<H4>2.10 Are there any internationalization or localization issues?</H4>

<P>This JSR will use the I18N support in Java SE.
</P>

<H4>2.11 Are there any existing specifications that might be rendered obsolete, deprecated, or in need of revision as a result of this work?</H4>

<P>
Java Servlet 4.0 Specification may need revision to reflect per-servlet login configuration proposed in this JSR.
