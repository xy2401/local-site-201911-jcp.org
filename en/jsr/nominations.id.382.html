Founding member of the Griffon framework and Hackergarten community event.

Andres is the Spec lead of JSR-377 (Desktop Application API). This JSR requires a configuration API (currently has one of its own) but it'll be great if it relied on JSR-382 to achieve the same goal.</td>

I've worked on implementing various cloud-native features and extensions to Java with KumuluzEE (such as config, discovery, metrics, fault-tolerance, ...) and worked on aligning them with the MicroProfile specifications. I'm the head of development of integration and cloud solutions in the high-tech start-up Sunesis d.o.o., and have worked on numerous projects developing advanced cloud-native applications for enterprises in Slovenia and abroad. I worked on building, implementing and migrating to a modern microservice architecture for various enterprises, most of which were based on core Java and now MicroProfile cloud-native features and extensions. My work and contributions on Java cloud-native microservices features and extensions is heavily inspired by real-world use cases and requirements that I ran into and needed to solve in big enterprise systems.</td>
