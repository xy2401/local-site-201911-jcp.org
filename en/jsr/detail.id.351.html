</P>

<H4>2.1 Please describe the proposed Specification:</H4>

<P><DL>
    <DD><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">The objective of
    this project is to define application programming interfaces and
    identity interaction models that facilitate and control the use of
    identity by applications and in access control decisions.</FONT></DD><DD>
    <BR>
    </DD><DD>
    <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">To meet this
    objective, we will define interfaces that are integrated with the
    Java security model and that enable a declarative application
    programming style. We will also define interfaces to attach
    meta-data to identity attributes (e.g., email address, social
    security number, bank account number, date of birth, nationality,
    gender) and a vocabulary of identity characterizing meta-data (e.g.,
    issuer, validity period, usage constraints) to be used in support of
    the identity interaction models. We will define an attribute service
    as the point of governance and of interaction with distributed
    sources of identity. We will also define interfaces that do the
    following:</FONT></DD><DD>
    <BR>
    </DD><DD>
    <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">- Enable applications
    to act both as consumers and as providers of attributes</FONT></DD><DD>
    <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">- Facilitate the
    insertion of access control checks in applications and the use of
    attributes in access control decisions</FONT></DD><DD>
    <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">- Allow users to
    authorize disclosure and use of their identity attributes</FONT></DD><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">
    <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">- Sustain the
    protection of identity attributes during their propagation between
    applications and systems</FONT></DD><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">
    <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif"><I>Example: A
    developer creates a prescription renewal application for use by
    subscribers of a health care provider. The developer uses the Java
    Identity API to reference attributes of the subscriber such as
    subscriber identifier, preferred pharmacy, renewable prescriptions,
    and service affiliation groups. The developer may also utilize
    attribute meta-data such as the last time the attributes were
    updated.</I></FONT></DD><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">
    <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif"><I>The developer does
    not describe how the attributes are to be obtained. When the
    application is deployed by a specific health care provider, the
    attribute references are resolved against the distributed attribute
    sources and user authentication tokens in use by the health care
    provider. This linkage is established without recompiling or
    changing the application. Further, the governance aspects of the API
    support tracking and managing the use of attributes both within the
    application and in its communication with other components. </I></FONT>
    </DD></DL>
 </P>

<H4>2.2 What is the target Java platform? (i.e., desktop, server, personal, embedded, card, etc.)</H4>

<P><P STYLE="margin-left: 0.4in"><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">The
target platform is Java SE and the proposed API is intended to be
applicable to Java platforms that retain the SE security framework
(including Java EE). It is assumed that the proposed API will depend
on a small set of basic services, including resource injection and
life-cycle callbacks, that are provided by the encompassing
environment.</FONT></P></P>

<H4>2.3 The Executive Committees would like to ensure JSR submitters think about how their proposed technology relates to all of the Java platform editions. Please provide details here for which platform editions are being targeted by this JSR, and how this JSR has considered the relationship with the other platform editions.</H4>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.4in"><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">This
specification is targeted for compatibility with Java SE and Java EE
platforms beginning with Version 6.0. We also expect the output of
this project to be relevant to Java applications running in consumer
appliances.</FONT></P>

<H4>2.4 Should this JSR be voted on by both Executive Committees?</H4>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.4in"><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif">No</FONT></P>


<H4>2.5 What need of the Java community will be addressed by the proposed specification?</H4>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.4in"><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">The
advent of social networking sites, the adoption of single-sign-on and
identity federation services, and more generally, the increased use
of the internet in conducting business, have combined to amplify the
need for Java developers to be able to appropriately consume,
produce, and safeguard the disclosure of network identity. The lack
of adequate interfaces in the Java platform is forcing application,
system, and identity framework developers to rely on non-standard
interfaces, which is resulting in indirect, inconsistent, poorly
integrated, and inferior support for network identity.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.4in"><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">Java
developers need interfaces that allow them to:</FONT></FONT></P>
<DL>
	<DD><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">- encapsulate and
	attribute application-specific types and mechanism-specific security
	credentials to sustain their common use and interpretation as
	identity attributes</FONT></DD><DD>
	<BR>
	</DD><DD>
	<FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">- interact (including
	lookup, read, create, and delete) in a portable fashion with
	identity information of potentially varying type and from
	potentially distributed sources</FONT></DD><DD>
	<BR>
	</DD><DD>
	<FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">- establish
	references that identify the one or more attributes of the one or
	more entities that are to be the target of an interaction</FONT></DD><DD>
	<BR>
	</DD><DD>
	<FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">- export attributes
	from applications such that they can be referenced in context from
	other systems, including in support of the processing of
	fine-grained policies during access control decisions performed in
	the context of the application.</FONT></DD><DD>
	<BR>
	</DD><DD>
	<FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">- establish the use
	and authorization policies relating to any attributes they create,
	export, or otherwise manage.</FONT></DD><DD>
	<BR>
	</DD><DD>
	<FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">- exchange attributes
	between applications and systems including in a manner that sustains
	authorization protection of the attributes</FONT></DD><DD STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.2in">
	<BR><BR>
	</DD></DL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.4in">
<FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">In
addition to the needs of Java developers, an effective interaction
model for network identity requires a governance model in which it
must be possible to predict, monitor, and control (such as via access
control checks) interactions by applications with identity
attributes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>

<H4>2.6 Why isn't this need met by existing specifications?</H4>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.4in"><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">The
Java security model protects the resources of the Java runtime
environment from both the calling code and the entity (for example,
user) on whose behalf the calling code is executing. Unlike the
CodeSource object which provides a standard interface for identifying
code and for certifying its integrity, the Principal interface, which
is used to represent on whose behalf the code is running,
standardizes only a very superficial representation of that entity.
While Java defines some objects (e.g., KerberosTicket and
X509Certificate) that encapsulate identity and identity qualifying
information(for example, issuer and validity period) such objects are
poorly suited to the task of representing identity values that are
not intrinsic to the corresponding security mechanism and its
associated transfer syntax (e.g., ASN.1). For example, neither a
KerberosTicket or an X509Certificate can offer an effective Java
binding for a generic identity attribute such as social security
number. Moreover, as noted above, it is the Principal objects (e.g.,
KerberosPrincipal and X500Principal) that represent on whose behalf
some java code is running. Information in any encapsulating
credentials is not generally available when (for example) an access
control decision is being performed, and the existing Principal
interface represents only a name without any common capacity to
represent identity qualifying information. As such, Java developers
and the Java security model require additional interfaces to
standardize a more complete representation and interaction model for
identity attributes. Further, Java does not assign or otherwise
establish a model or architecture for use in defining the terms that
govern the disclosure of its representations of network identity.</FONT></FONT></P>

<H4>2.7 Please give a short description of the underlying technology or technologies:</H4>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.4in; margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">As
an initial proposal, this JSR proposes to deliver standard interfaces
and functionality at 3 layers. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.4in; margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">Layer
1: Representation and JRE integration</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.4in"><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">We
propose to define new attribute interfaces to represent identity
attributes and associated meta-data. These interfaces would be used
to facilitate common representation of existing Java Object types as
identity attributes, to convey identity attributes within the Java
access control context, to facilitate integration with the standard
java.security.Policy decision interface, and to reference and
represent content acquired from the attribute service.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.4in"><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">We
expect consideration of the representation of relationships among
attributes and collections of attributes to factor in the definition
of the representation layer.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.4in"><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">Layer
2: Services</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.4in"><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">We
propose to define Attribute Service interfaces to support interaction
with attributes in one or more attribute repositories, and to support
the integration of applications as attribute providers accessible
within this service framework.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.4in"><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">For
the reference implementation, we will provide a Policy subsystem that
is able to consume policies that are contingent on identity
attributes acquired from the Attribute Service. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.4in"><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">The
reference implementation will also include one or more attribute
providers that facilitate integration with existing identity
repositories and protocols. The specific integrations included in the
reference implementation will be decided by the Expert Group; while
recognizing that the specification will define contracts to
facilitate additional repository integrations by third parties.
FaceBook, Twitter, and LinkedIn will be among the identity
repositories considered for integration within the reference
integration, as will their associated programming interfaces and
protocols, including FaceBook Connect, OpenID Connect, and OAUTH 2.0.
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.4in"><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">We
expect consideration of support for multi-tenancy to factor in the
definition of the services layer. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.4in; margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">Layer
3: Application development</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.4in; margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">We
propose to define annotations that will cause the injection of
Identity attributes and or references to identity attributes into
applications. We also propose to define annotations that will cause
application fields to be exported as attributes to the attribute
service.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.4in; margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">We
also intend to describe the use of annotations to cause the insertion
of attribute-based policy enforcement points within applications.
Where feasible, we will reuse or extend extend existing standard
annotations. We will also propose and advocate for improvements in
the existing Java access control interfaces to facilitate more
efficient enforcement of user-centric
access control decisions.</FONT></FONT></P>

<H4>2.8 Is there a proposed package name for the API Specification? (i.e., <TT>javapi.something</TT>, <TT>org.something</TT>, etc.)</H4>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.4in"><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">javax.security.identity</FONT></P>

<H4>2.9 Does the proposed specification have any dependencies on specific operating systems, CPUs, or I/O devices that you know of?</H4>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.4in"><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif">no</FONT></FONT></P>

<H4>2.10 Are there any security issues that cannot be addressed by the current security model?</H4>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.4in"><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif">The
current security model does not describe or otherwise address the
need for an identity governance model; i.e., a model or framework
that is used to determine and control how identity information is
used, stored and propagated between systems.</FONT></P>

<H4>2.11 Are there any internationalization or localization issues?</H4>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.4in"><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans serif, sans-serif">This
specification will rely on I18N support in Java SE</FONT></FONT></P>

<H4>2.12 Are there any existing specifications that might be rendered obsolete, deprecated, or in need of revision as a result of this work?</H4>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.4in"><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif">no</FONT></P>

<H4>2.13 Please describe the anticipated schedule for the development of this

coordinates of the enforcement point (i.e., the method or class on
which the enforcement point is embedded). In another scenario,
including instance specific access control, the target resource and
