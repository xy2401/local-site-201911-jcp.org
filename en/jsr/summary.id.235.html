</P>

<H4>2.1 Please describe the proposed Specification:</H4>

<P>This specification will define core infrastructure APIs for heterogeneous data access that supports common application patterns and supports higher-level tools and frameworks.<P>

An established best-practice in J2EE programming is encapsulating business data passed between tiers of an n-tier application in a by-value Java object that is independent of the technologies used to implement the tiers (note that these tiers are sometimes purely logical - that is, in the same Java VM). [1] [2] [3] [5] [7] This pattern, called "Data Transfer Object" [1] [5] [7] and "Transfer Object" [2] [3], will be called Service Data Objects (SDOs) here. SDOs are used in several standard patterns.<P>
<ul>
 * Service Data Objects are used to pass data between a business tier and a persistence tier. The persistence tier is responsible for encapsulating the access to whatever persistent data storage mechanism is being used. The Service Data Object represents the data in a way that is independent of the underlying persistence technology.<BR>
 * Service Data Objects are used to pass data from the presentation tier (e.g. servlets and JSPs) to the business logic tier (e.g. An EJB session bean facade)<BR>
 * Data Access Objects [4] [6] abstract and encapsulate a data source by creating and using Service Data Objects as the neutral form of data across applications and data sources.  Data Access Objects will be called Data Mediator Services (DMS) here.</ul><P>

In simple scenarios, Service Data Objects can be implemented simply by defining a straightforward Java class. However, supporting more sophisticated scenarios can be very challenging and requires more than a simple JavaBean-based approach. This proposed specification for Service Data Objects addresses a range of more sophisticated scenarios:<P>

1. Change History.<BR>
It is a common pattern for a client to receive an SDO from another tier, make updates to the SDO, and then pass the modified SDO back to the other tier. To support this scenario, it is often important for the tier receiving the modified SDO to know what modifications were made. In simple cases, knowing whether or not the SDO was modified may be enough. For other cases, it may be necessary (or at least desirable) to know which fields (or bean properties) were modified. Some standard optimistic collision detection algorithms require knowledge not only of which columns changed, but also what the previous values were. Service Data Objects will support full change history.<P>

2. Compound Data Objects. <BR>
It is common to have to deal with "complex" or "compound" Data Objects. This is the case where the SDO is the root of a tree, or even a graph of objects. An example of a tree would be a SDO for an Order that has references to other SDOs for the Line Items. If each of the Line Items had a reference to a SDO for Product Descriptions, the set of objects would form a graph. When dealing with compound data objects, the change history is significantly harder to implement because inserts, deletes, adds and removes, and reordering have to be tracked as well as simple changes. Service Data Objects will support arbitrary graphs of SDOs with full change summaries.<P>

3. Navigation<BR>
An important aspect of SDO is the ability to navigate from one SDO to another by API or by expression.  Within a graph of SDOs, all objects are reachable by successive API calls or by constructing and processing a path expression.  SDO supports navigation between data objects using a path expression subset of the XPath 1 [8] specification.<P>

4. Dynamic APIs, with support for generated APIs<BR>
SDOs will commonly have typed Java interfaces (i.e., the common JavaBeans that application programmers are familiar with). However, sometimes it is either impossible or undesirable to create Java interfaces to represent the SDOs. One common situation in which this occurs is where the data being transferred is defined by the output of a query. Examples would be a relational query against a relational persistence store, or EJBQL queries against an EJB entity bean domain model, or XML Query queries against an XML source. In these situations, it is necessary to use a dynamic store and associated API. One simple approach in these situations is to use an implementation of java.util.Map [2]. However, this implementation does not provide any change history (see above), meta-data (see below), validation and constraints (see below) or relationship integrity (see below). Service Data Objects will have the ability to represent SDOs through a standard dynamic API without the need to generate Java classes. Dynamic SDO classes will support the full meta-data, validation and relationship integrity features of code-generated SDO classes. SDO can also be used in conjunction with systems that generate static Java APIs, such as class generated by JAXB from an XML Schema Definition. The generated implementation classes will then support both the familiar JavaBeans interface as well as the dynamic APIs.<P>

5. Meta-Data<BR>
Many applications are coded with built-in knowledge of the shape of the data being returned. These applications know which methods to call or fields to access on the Service Data Objects they use. However, in order to enable development of generic or framework code that works with SDOs, it is important to be able to "introspect" to retrieve metadata for these objects. If the SDOs are implemented using Java classes, normal Java introspection will return basic information about fields, methods or Java Bean properties. However, Java introspection will not return information about the expected types of objects in collections, containment, inverse relationships, or constraints. It is very desirable to have this extended metadata. Service Data Objects will support simple meta-data that describes types, their attributes, their relationships, containment, multiplicity, sequences, use of settings in properties, and constraints. This metadata can be populated from various metadata models, such as XML Schema [10], the Essential Meta Object Facility (EMOF) [9], etc.<P>


6. Faithfully represent the semantics of business data without exposing the details of underlying storage technology.  <BR>
It is an accepted best practice that the client should not be exposed to the implementation technologies used by the provider. For example, a data persistence tier should not expose to the client whether the underlying persistence technology is a relational database, an XML database, an OO database, files, or a set of interactions with an Enterprise Information System. The interface to the persistence layer should expose all the semantics of the underlying business data without loss. Service Data Objects will use only technology-neutral data-types and other technology-neutral meta-data concepts while supporting data semantics rich enough to cover relational data, XML data, EJB data, JCA data and other popular data representations.<P>

7. Support for XML, XML Schema and Web Services<BR>
The content of XML data is more complex from that of relational data and object data. For instance, XML data includes the properties of order of elements, and content models can allow "mixed content". The SDO model will support the necessary concepts from XML to be able to represent XML data. This will enable Web services messages to be accessible using SDOs (i.e., Web services messages can be viewed as serializations of SDOs). The SDO meta-data API will also support a small and simple client view of the schema language underlying the XML (e.g., W3C XML Schema). This will allow SDO to be integrated with other Java-XML technologies, such as XML-Java data binding solutions (e.g., JAXB) and Java-based Web services (e.g., JAX-RPC). Note that this specification does not define integration with these technologies. Rather, the goal of this specification is to enable these integrations for the future.<P>

8. Import/generation from popular interface definition formats<BR>
In order to support implementation of objects that support data transfer between tiers, it is necessary to be able to create definitions of data transfer objects from the popular interface technologies of each of those tiers. This includes WSDL/XML Schema as discussed above, EJB entity beans, relational database schemas, JCA connectors, JMS message formats etc. In addition, import from design descriptions such as UML is desirable. Service Data Objects will support import of Service Data Object definitions from popular formats. Note that this specification does not define the import mechanisms itself; this will be left up to implementations and possibly future specifications.<P>

9. Validation and Constraints<BR>
When representing data exchanged with a tier, it is important not to lose information about the semantics of that data. When SDOs are implemented directly as Java objects, basic type information can be preserved. This information is lost with java.util.Map implementations. In addition to basic type information, for both static and dynamic implementations, it is important to preserve and enforce information about other constraints. Examples are information about maximum String lengths (e.g. for properties corresponding to columns in a relational database table), or constraints on value ranges (e.g. for properties whose types are defined by XML Schema simple type restrictions). Service Data Objects will support a set of standard constraints designed to support the popular constraints expressible in relational databases and XML schema, and will also provide an extensible mechanism for adding new constraint types as well as validation capability for those constraints.<P>

10. Relationship integrity<BR>
An important special case of constraints is the ability to define relationships between objects and to enforce the integrity of those constraints, including cardinality, ownership semantics and inverses. For example, consider the case where an employee has a relationship to its department and a department inversely has a list of its employees. If the value of the department is set for an employee, the employee should be automatically removed from the list of employees held by the department it is currently in, and the employee should be added to the list of employees for the new department. Service Data Object relationships use regular Java objects as opposed to primary and foreign keys with external relationships.  Support for containment tree integrity is also important.<P>

11. Integration with presentation-tier technologies<BR>
One of the important scenarios for SDOs is passing data between a presentation tier and a business logic tier. In order to be useful with standard J2EE presentation tier technologies such as JSTL and JSF, without copying or creation of wrappers, the Service Data Objects specification will have as its goal good integration with these technologies. <P>

12. Serialization<BR>
The Java serialization of SDOs should have an on the wire format independent of implementation for interoperability.  Service Data Objects will follow an XML serialization format and implementation classes will implement the java.io.Serializable interface.

Relationships to other JSRs:
<P>
JSR 12 JDO<BR>
JDO is a way of transparently persisting JavaBeans. SDO is a way of representing data that is received from or sent to a "service" or "tier", especially but not exclusively a data persistence "tier". SDO could be used to pass data back and forth between a JDO-based persistence tier and a business logic tier or presentation tier
<P>
JSR 31 JAXB 1.0<BR>
JSR 222 JAXB 2.0<BR>
The SDO specification defines dynamic data APIs and metadata APIs; it does not define static Java interfaces for XML Schema. Thus, SDO could be used in conjunction with JAXB.<P>
JSR 40 - JMI<BR>
The JMI 1.0 specification defines Java APIs for the OMG MOF 1.4 specification, which provides a comprehensive object-based metadata model. The SDO specification creates a very small metadata model designed specifically for common use cases that clients applications need. We expect that other metadata models, such as MOF, XML Schema, etc. can be used by data mediator services.
<P>
JSR 114 - RowSet Implementations<BR>
JSR-114 provides a type of JDBC RowSet called CachedRowSet that provides a disconnected model of data access for relational data. While both CachedRowSet and SDO support the disconnected model, SDO is meant for data from heterogeneous sources, not just relational data sources. In particular, RowSet, and CachedRowSet, have the following limitations that make it unsuitable for the use cases SDO is addressing:
* Lets underlying relational persistence concepts show through
o SQL types
o Relational organization (rows)
o JDBC-specific meta-data
* Mixes multiple different roles in a single object (Data Transfer Object/SDO, Data Access Object/DMS, Iterator)
* Does not support and is not easily extended to other data sources such as XML, JCA, EJBs etc.
* Does not naturally support generation of statically-typed Java classes for accessing data
* Cannot be easily used directly with JSTL or JSF
* Does not directly support containment, object relationships, and inverses.
<P>
JSR-227 -- A Standard Data Binding & Data Access Facility for J2EE
JSR-227 proposes a facility to declaratively bind Web user interface components to heterogeneous back-end data sources. For example, JavaServer Faces components (e.g., a grid component) could be bound to relational data or XML data from a Web service. The SDO specification provides the lower-level primitives that could be used by JSR-227.

Winter 2003: Expert Group Formed<BR>
Early Summer 2004: Release Community Draft<BR>
Late Summer 2004: Release Public Review Draft<BR>
Fall 2004: Final Release

</P>

<H4>2.12 Please describe the anticipated working model for the Expert Group working on developing this
specification.</H4>

<P>IBM will lead the specification and implementation work, with experts contributing to the API specification. <BR>
This will include email discussions, monthly phone calls and possibly a F2F meeting.
The environment of the expert group will be totally non-confidential. We will also use or create an open mailing list for discussions by other interested people outside the expert group. As the outbound licenses will be royalty free (see section 2.15), expert group members  will need to ensure that their contributions are similarly made on that basis. Non-EG contributors to the mailing list will also be requested to provide that assurance. 


</P>

<H4>2.13 Please describe how the RI and TCK will de delivered, i.e. as part of a profile or platform edition, or stand-alone, or both. Include version information for the profile or platform in your answer.
</H4>

<P>The RI and TCK will be made available in stand-alone form at the time of the final release. There will most likely be earlier versions of the RI and TCK that are developed as this JSR progresses.<P>

The RI will be generic to any particular container and not use any proprietary interfaces, and therefore should work with existing container implementations. <P>

IBM will be responsible for developing the TCK, although contributions from any Expert Group member would be welcome.<BR>
BEA will be responsible for developing the RI, although assistance from any Expert Group member would be welcome.






</P>

<H4>2.14 Please state the rationale if previous versions are available stand-alone and you are now proposing in 2.13 to only deliver RI and TCK as part of a profile or platform edition (See sections 1.1.5 and 1.1.6 of the JCP 2 document).
</H4>

<P>Not applicable.</P>

<H4>2.15 Please provide a description of the business terms for the Specification, RI and TCK that will apply when this JSR is final.</H4>

<P>The Specification will be offered under royalty-free terms and thus be freely implementable. This license will comply with the terms defined by the JSPA. For an approximation of the Specification license, please see the license statements included in the specifications listed in section 3.1.<P>

The intention is to release the RI and TCK under licenses of a form of the draft licenses included as Exhibit A and Exhibit B in section 4.1, respectively. At this stage it is expected that IBM and BEA will strive to use a common license for the RI and similarly for the TCK.</P>

NOTE: participants in this expert group must sign a supplemental license agreement to enable an external specification, which has already been published with royalty free patent grants for essential claims, to remain in sync with any enhancements done by the expert group while the expert group completes its work. To that end, the supplemental agreement changes the timing of some of the IP grants that EG members must make. The agreement may be downloaded <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/JCP_SCLA.pdf">here</a>.
