<H4>2.1 Please describe the proposed Specification:</H4>

<P>In the past, the J2ME community has developed a unified Java application environment standard for mobile phones (JSR-185). The design center for JSR-185 is devices with resources and capabilities to address the current market needs for volume devices. This JSR broadens the set of requirements to address new device capabilities but will continue its focus on the high-volume mobile devices. This JSR will broaden the architecture defined by JSR-185 to incorporate new technologies for the volume mobile devices and will also oversee compatibility between the environment being defined by the corresponding Mobile Service Architecture JSR.<P>

This JSR and the accompanying Mobile Service Architecture JSR address distinct segments. Thus, both platforms are needed. We recognize that there are devices that are suitable for both application environments, but this is inherent in the diversity of devices. The intention is that the Mobile Service Architecture specification would support Mobile Service Architecture as well. Part of the role of the Mobile Service Architecture specification work will be to address different market views to help successfully set industry direction.<P>

This JSR Expert Group (EG) will produce the following documents:<P>

  - The Mobile Service Architecture Specification: The Mobile Service Architecture Specification is an architectural overview that describes the essential client components of an end-to-end wireless environment. It will describe recommended combinations of technologies using J2ME. It is a guide for the correct use of the various Java technologies that can be used in a wireless environment. As a normative specification, the Mobile Service Architecture Specification will trigger compatibility requirements to be reflected in the TCK. Service and content providers can use the Mobile Service Architecture Specification as a target for development and require conformance. <P>

  - The Mobile Service Architecture Roadmap: The Mobile Service Architecture Roadmap is a document that describes a roadmap for the technology. It is the basis for the new version of the Mobile Service Architecture Specification and defines a technological direction and plans to get to this new revision. This document describes relevant technologies, then references JSRs being developed and in progress. This is not a normative document, unlike the Mobile Service Architecture Specification. <P>

In addition to these specifications, this expert group may advise the J2ME Executive Committee, JSR-68, the J2ME architecture specification expert group, and other expert groups, which may be doing work in the mobile/wireless arena. <BR>
This expert group will also work as the expert group for the respective Mobile Service Architecture Advanced JSR. </P>

<H4>2.2 What is the target Java platform? (i.e., desktop, server, personal, embedded, card, etc.)</H4>

<P>Mobile Handsets.</P>

<H4>2.3 The Executive Committees would like to ensure JSR submitters think about how their proposed technology relates to all of the Java platform editions. Please provide details here for which platform editions are being targeted by this JSR, and how this JSR has considered the relationship with the other platform editions.</H4>

<P>The target platform is the MID Profile on J2ME.</P>

<H4>2.4 Should this JSR be voted on by both Executive Committees?</H4>

<P>No</P>


<H4>2.5 What need of the Java community will be addressed by the proposed specification?</H4>

<P>There is a need to have a single expert group select the relevant technologies for a single specification for the purposes of defining primarily CLDC based mobile handset platform for the wireless industry. In addition, this specification will provide continual architectural consistency, focus, and direction to this collection of efforts for J2ME. Also there is a need in the marketplace for a clear statement of how the various technologies fit and work together.


</P>

<H4>2.6 Why isn't this need met by existing specifications?</H4>

<P>The existing J2ME JSRs and specifications target specific APIs and technologies. In addition, the relevant configuration and profile JSRs (139 & 118) define an application environment that is not only scoped to mobile handsets. The net result is that many of the JSRs are more general than appropriate for mobile phones. This JSR provides guidelines to integrate J2ME JSRs in a uniform and predictable arrangement that is customized specifically for the high-volume handsets. It will issue clarifications on certain components if necessary and will aim at reducing the number of available options.


 </P>

<H4>2.7 Please give a short description of the underlying technology or technologies:</H4>

<P>As stated in section 2.1, the basic underlying technologies include MIDP 2.0 based on CLDC 1.1 and the optional packages fulfilling the selected fit for purpose criteria and defined for the wireless industry this specification is intended and may as well be implemented in CDC environment.</P>

<H4>2.8 Is there a proposed package name for the API Specification? (i.e., <TT>javapi.something</TT>, <TT>org.something</TT>, etc.)</H4>

<P>This JSR does not intend to define new APIs.</P>

<H4>2.9 Does the proposed specification have any dependencies on specific operating systems, CPUs, or I/O devices that you know of?</H4>

<P>No</P>

<H4>2.10 Are there any security issues that cannot be addressed by the current security model?</H4>

<P>No</P>

<H4>2.11 Are there any internationalization or localization issues?</H4>

<P>No</P>

<H4>2.12 Are there any existing specifications that might be rendered obsolete, deprecated, or in need of revision as a result of this work?</H4>

<P>Yes. This JSR is a revision of JSR-185 JTWI 1.0 and will supersede it.</P>

<H4>2.13 Please describe the anticipated schedule for the development of this
specification.</H4>

<P>The targeted schedule for the JSR is as follows:<BR>
 - Expert Group formation: September 2004<BR>
 - Early Draft Review: December 2004<BR>
 - Public Review: January 2005<BR>
 - Proposed Final Draft: May 2005<BR>
 - Final Approval Ballot: September 2005</P>

<H4>2.14 Please describe the anticipated working model for the Expert Group working on developing this
specification.</H4>

<P>The Expert Group will use email communications, regular telephone conferences and face-to-face meetings at two to three month intervals.<P>
 
Since this Expert Group will also be working on the Mobile Service Architecture JSR, the purpose is to try to synchronize the work on both specifications and the corresponding meetings.<P>

The goal of the specification lead for this JSR is to achieve expert group consensus on all decisions regarding the specification and related documents.<P>

In addition to the Expert Group, a group of Observers may be created for interested parties, who can follow the work of the Expert Group but cannot participate in the discussions, work or decision making itself. <P>



</P>

<H4>2.15 It is important to the success of the community and each JSR that the work of the Expert Group be handled in a manner which provides the community and the public with insight into the work the Expert Group is doing, and the decisions that the Expert Group has made. The Executive Committees would like to ensure Spec Leads understand the value of this transparency and ask that each JSR have an operating plan in place for how their JSR will address the involvement of the community and the public. Please provide your plan here, and refer to the Spec Lead Guide for a more detailed description and a set of example questions you may wish to answer in your plan.</H4>

<P>Transparency plan:<P>

  a) The specification lead will maintain an Observer interest list for JCP members outside of the Expert Group (EG). Observers may follow the progress of the JSR by the periodic short briefs about the progress of the remaining open issues and specification drafts created by this JSR as will be decided by the Expert Group. However, Observers will not be entitled to participate in the Expert Group meetings (face-to-face or telephone conferences).  The Expert Group may also use the list to request feedback on key issues facing the group.<P>

  b) The specification lead will, on a quarterly basis, provide a brief JSR status to the JCP PMO, for publication to the Java community. This will include the current schedule for the JSR and notes on any major events that have occurred in the previous quarter.<P>



 </P>

<H4>2.16 Please describe how the RI and TCK will de delivered, i.e. as part of a profile or platform edition, or stand-alone, or both. Include version information for the profile or platform in your answer.
</H4>

<P>The TCK will be delivered separately from the RI, if any.<P>

Due to the special nature of this JSR, the TCK from this JSR will contain the documentation and software, covering Mobile Service Architecture compliancy requirements, and a list referring to TCKs of those Java Specifications that are part of Mobile Service Architecture Specification, additional testcases created in this JSR and instructions and guidance of how to run the tests.<P>

The individual Component JSR TCKs are not included in the Mobile Service Architecture TCK delivery package. However, this JSR may explore the possibility to deliver the TCK, which would include the tests included in the TCKs for the referred individual Java Specifications.<P>

Due to the special nature of this JSR, the RI code, if any, will be created, only for those additional clarifications and complementing portions of the specification that have been created in this JSR.</P>

<H4>2.17 Please state the rationale if previous versions are available stand-alone and you are now proposing in 2.13 to only deliver RI and TCK as part of a profile or platform edition (See sections 1.1.5 and 1.1.6 of the JCP 2 document).
</H4>
