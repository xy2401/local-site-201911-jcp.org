<H4>2.1 Please describe the proposed Specification:</H4>
<P>
Java Archives (JARs) are widely used as both the distribution and 
execution format for Java applications. The JAR format dates back to the 
mid-1990s, and it has not scaled particularly well in either of these 
roles. JAR files are hard to distribute, hard to version, and hard to 
reference in general.
<P>

Distributing a simple Java application is considered to be a complicated 
task by many developers because it often involves creating a native 
installer to package multiple JARs into a distribution unit, and it 
sometimes involves converting the application into a Java applet or JNLP 
(Java Network Launching Protocol) application for web-based deployment.
<P>

There is no built-in versioning support in the JAR format. There is no 
reliable mechanism for expressing, resolving, and enforcing the 
dependency of one JAR upon another. Referencing a JAR, moreover, 
involves specifying it in the classpath. Since the path of a JAR may 
change during deployment, developers are forced to fix up all the 
references to the deployed JARs as part of the deployment process.
<P>

Developers also find it quite difficult to deploy installed Java 
extensions (a.k.a optional packages) because they can easily run into 
issues like versioning conflict and namespace collision. Java extensions 
can currently only be installed into a specific Java Runtime Environment 
(JRE); it is basically impossible to arrange for an installed extension 
to be shared across multiple JRE installations.
<P>

The specification of the Java Module System should define an 
infrastructure that addresses the above issues. Its components are 
likely to include:
<P>

o A distribution format (i.e., a Java module) and its metadata as a unit 
of delivery for packaging collections of Java code and related 
resources. The metadata would contain information about a module, the 
resources within the module, and its dependencies upon other modules. 
The metadata would also include an export list to restrict resources 
from being exposed outside the module unintentionally. The metadata may 
allow subset of exposed resources to be used by other modules selectively.
<P>

o A versioning scheme that defines how a module declares its own version 
as well its versioned dependencies upon other modules.
<P>

o A repository for storing and retrieving modules on the machine with 
versioning and namespaces isolation support.
<P>

o Runtime support in the application launcher and class loaders for the 
discovery, loading, and integrity checking of modules.
<P>

o A set of support tools, including packaging tools as well as 
repository tools to support module installation and removal.
<P>

We also expect the Java Module System to expose the public Java SE APIs 
as a virtual module in order to prevent unwanted usage of the private 
APIs in the implementation.


<H4>2.2 What is the target Java platform? (i.e., desktop, server, personal, embedded, card, etc.)</H4>

<P>Java SE.

<H4>2.3 The Executive Committees would like to ensure JSR submitters think about how their proposed technology relates to all of the Java platform editions. Please provide details here for which platform editions are being targeted by this JSR, and how this JSR has considered the relationship with the other platform editions.</H4>

<P>This JSR is submitted to the Java SE EC although we expect the 
functionality in this JSR to be heavily used by Java EE.


<H4>2.6 Why isn't this need met by existing specifications?</H4>
<P>
The existing specifications are inadequate to addresses the following 
issues:
<P>

1. No uniform deployment model for Java application and extensions.
<P>

The Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP, JSR 56) defines a protocol 
and API that enables Java applications to be deployed on the web. A JNLP 
descriptor is simply an XML file that describes a collection of 
resources on the web and the launching options for deploying an 
application or extension. A JNLP descriptor is completely unbounded with 
respect to the resources on the web; there is no concept of distribution 
unit. Because a JNLP descriptor describes resources on the web, it 
contains hardcoded URLs to the resources, and it is difficult to 
redistribute the application from different hosts (e.g., for 
load-balancing) or to deploy from a different target (e.g., Intranet 
server or CD install). Resource versioning in JNLP is arbitrary, and it 
does not tie to the actual version of the resource. Finally, in order to 
take advantage of JNLP, an application or extension must be converted to 
run in a JNLP client container; this makes JNLP unsuitable as a general 
application deployment model.
<P>

The Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) specification defines 
WARs (web application archive) and EARs (enterprise application archive) 
as packaging formats for Java EE-based applications. These packaging 
formats were designed for deployment with Java EE containers (i.e., web 
containers and EJB containers). They cannot be retrofitted for general 
application deployment purpose.
<P>

The Java EE specification also mandates explicit support for referencing 
dependent JARs through the "Class-Path:" manifest entry in the Java EE 
module. However, the "Class-Path:" entry requires dependent JARs to be 
referenced through either relative or full file system paths, and there 
is no built-in versioning support. Therefore, the "Class-Path:" entry is 
not a sufficient solution to address the JAR referencing problem.
<P>

In addition, the Java EE specification mandates explicit support for 
referencing installed extensions through the "Extension-List:" manifest 
entry in the Java EE module. However, the "Extension-List:" entry only 
supports extension dependency based on the minimum version of a 
specification or the minimum version of an implementation, and there is 
no support for exact version or version range. Thus, the 
"Extension-List:" entry is not a sufficient solution to address the JAR 
referencing problem.
<P>

The R3 version of the Open Services Gateway Initiative (OSGi) 
specification defines a framework that enables the deployment of 
service-oriented applications (called bundles). However, the framework 
only supports package dependency based on the minimum version of a 
specification, and there is no support for exact version or version 
range. The framework also supports package dependency based on an 
implementation, but there is no support for versioning. Moreover, the 
framework must choose one bundle that will be the provider of the 
exported package for all bundles which have dependencies on that 
package, so it is impossible to support more than one version of shared 
package at runtime. Besides, the selection of exported package provider 
is anonymous, and there is no way to influence the selection. Because 
the versioning semantics in the OSGi R3 framework is simplistic, it is 
not a sufficient solution to address the JAR referencing problem.
<P>

2. No means to resolve versioning conflicts and namespace collision 
among Java extensions in a JRE.
<P>

The Java Extension Architecture defines how JARs may be referenced 
through the "Class-Path:" entry in the JAR manifest as bundled 
extensions, and how JARs may be referenced from {java.home}/lib/ext as 
installed extensions. Unfortunately, the extension mechanism loads all 
JARs in the extension directory into the same extension classloader at 
runtime regardless of whether or not they are actually referenced by the 
application. As a result, if classes in a referenced JAR have a 
versioning conflict or namespace collision with classes in some other 
extension JARs, there is no simple way to resolve the problem.
<P>

3. No means to share Java extensions among different JREs on the same 
system.
<P>

The Java Extension Architecture allows JARs to be referenced from 
{java.home}/lib/ext as installed extensions. However, the location is 
JRE specific, so each JRE may have its own set of installed extensions, 
and maintaining consistency of installed extensions among JREs on a 
system is very tedious.

<H4>2.7 Please give a short description of the underlying technology or technologies:</H4>

<P>The Java SE platform already includes support for the JAR format, 
class-loader delegation, standard extensions, code signing, and 
verification.


<H4>2.12 Are there any existing specifications that might be rendered obsolete, deprecated, or in need of revision as a result of this work?</H4>

<P>The intent is to encourage developers to migrate away from the 
{java.home}/lib/ext directory as part of Java SE 7.

<H4>2.13 Please describe the anticipated schedule for the development of this 
specification.</H4>

<P>The intention is to deliver this JSR as a component of Java SE 7 (code 
name "Dolphin"). Early Draft Review would occur in the first half of 
2006, Public Review in the first half of 2007, and Proposed Final Draft 
in the second half of 2007.

<H4>2.16 Please describe how the RI and TCK will de delivered, i.e. as part of a profile or platform edition, or stand-alone, or both. Include version information for the profile or platform in your answer.
</H4>

<P>This JSR and its RI and TCK are intended to be part of the Java SE 7 RI 
and TCK, respectively.


<H4>2.18 Please provide a description of the business terms for the Specification, RI and TCK that will apply when this JSR is final.</H4>

<P>The RI and TCK will be delivered and licensed as part of the RI and TCK 
for Java SE 7.
