<P>

<a name="updates"><font size="+2">Updates to the Java Specification Request (JSR)</font></a><p>
The following information has been updated from <a href="#orig">the original JSR</a>:<P>

<b>2008.05.21</b>:  Specification Lead: Piotr Kessler, Stefan Svenberg - Ericsson AB.<P>

<a name="updates"><font size="+2">Updates to the Java Specification Request (JSR)</font></a><p>
The following information has been updated from <a href="#orig">the original JSR</a>:<P>

<B><U>2007.09.24</u></b>:<P>
<H4>2.1 Please describe the proposed Specification:</H4>

<P>This JSR is intended to enable application programmers to easily write applications that can integrate with the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS). The specification will expose IMS functionality through high-level APIs in an integrated and consistent way. The API hides IMS implementation details to the maximum extent. The API abstracts the underlying technology and at the same time provides the developers with maximum flexibility. This approach secures conformance to IMS related standards and at the same time gives developers possibility to focus on the functionality of the services and not on the IMS technology implementation details. In this way IMS domain will be revealed to the broad Java ME developer community and will encourage faster adoption of the IMS services provided by the wireless networks.
<P>

The IMS API defines a set of high-level functions enabling Java ME applications to access IMS functionality, e.g.:<BR>
<UL>
<li> High-level support for the IMS registration mechanism
<li> Support for co-location of multiple IMS Services 
<li> Use of IMS service sessions (based on SIP sessions) 
<li> Use of media connections 
<li> Addressing Quality of Service
<li> Hiding and encapsulating internal protocols managed and used by the IMS protocol stack.
</ul>
The IMS Services API allows application developers for mobile devices to easily utilize the IMS functionality without requiring knowledge of the underlying protocols and IMS implementation details. By direct support of the service bundling concept, the API supports one of the strengths of the IMS. The IMS Services API facilitates application developers to avoid violations of SIP and IMS conventions. In particular, the authentication mechanism used, is completely hidden from the application. As the user of the API does not have to be involved, the security risks associated with application level handling of authentication tokens is minimized. <P>

The IMS area is continuously developing with more functionality and Services. These will be of interest to Java. To avoid fragmentation issues in the future, the IMS Services API is designed so that it can function as a core API layer for future JSRs implementing IMS Services such as Push to Talk over Cellular (PoC) and Group List Management (GLM).
<P>
<H4>2.5 What need of the Java community will be addressed by the proposed specification?</H4>

<P>This API provides high-level access to IMS functionality for the development of innovative applications such as multi-party games, as well as applications that utilize standardized IMS functionality of today and in the future.
<P>

<H4>2.6 Why isn't this need met by existing specifications?</H4>

<P>Existing JSRs are either low-level (such as JSR-180) or high-level but specific to a particular application (such as JSR-186/187). JSR-180 requires detailed SIP knowledge and focuses a lot on P2P SIP based communication. Additionally usage of JSR 180 for applications utilizing the IMS, can lead to security issues if IMS conventions are not observed by the application developer. A high-level API does not only minimize those security problems but also reduces the risk to affect the operational safety of the IMS by restricting applications to proper behavior.</P>

<H4>2.7 Please give a short description of the underlying technology or technologies:</H4>

<P>IMS is a multimedia platform for packet-oriented access networks such as UMTS, EDGE, GPRS or W-LAN standardized by the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project). It enables mobile operators to offer numerous voice, multimedia and data services based on IP (Internet Protocol), SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) and 3GPP Release 5. An IMS subscriber can make use of a whole host of interaction and communication options - from games for the entertainment sector to business applications - with a single login. IMS offers a variety of basic network services, such as session control services (including registration, routing and roaming) and secure authentication. In addition is is also possible to implement flexible charging and payment, quality of service, presence and Push-to-Talk over Cellular.. 
</P>

specification.</H4>

-	Use of presence and group list management functionality
-	High level support for SDP according to RFC 2327</ul><BR>
The PoC part of the API is a high-level abstraction of the complex features provided by the PoC service, thus allowing for application programmers to write applications that make use of these features without having to deal with underlying details. The API allows for initiation, management and termination of PoC sessions with individual participants as well as pre-defined groups of participants. Furthermore it can be used to dynamically modify multiple PoC sessions in terms of adding or removing participants. The API provides support for control of talk bursts and operation of multiple simultaneous PoC sessions. The API facilitates integration of PoC functionality in arbitrary applications (e.g. multi-player games).
The GLM part of the API is a high level abstraction to handle group, access and contact lists for arbitrary applications in an easy and straight forward way.<P>
                  
The IMS Services API allows application developers for mobile devices to easily utilize the IMS functionality without requiring knowledge of the underlying SIP and IMS implementation details. By direct support of the service bundling concept, the API supports one of the strengths of the IMS. The IMS Services API facilitates application developers to avoid violations of SIP and IMS conventions. In particular, the authentication mechanism used, is completely hidden from the application. As the user of the API does not have to be involved, the security risks associated with application level handling of authentication tokens is minimized.

<H4>2.2 What is the target Java platform? (i.e., desktop, server, personal, embedded, card, etc.)</H4>

<P>Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> ME - both CLDC and CDC</P>

<H4>2.3 The Executive Committees would like to ensure JSR submitters think about how their proposed technology relates to all of the Java platform editions. Please provide details here for which platform editions are being targeted by this JSR, and how this JSR has considered the relationship with the other platform editions.</H4>

<P>Targets are the CLDC and CDC platforms within Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> ME. There is no direct relationship to other platform editions. </P>

<H4>2.4 Should this JSR be voted on by both Executive Committees?</H4>

<P>No</P>


<H4>2.5 What need of the Java community will be addressed by the proposed specification?</H4>

<P>This API provides high-level access to IMS functionality for the development of innovative applications as well as APIs for specific IMS services like PoC and Group List Management on Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> ME devices. Furthermore the PoC part facilitates integration of PoC functionality in arbitrary applications, e.g. multi-party games.</P>
<font color="red">NOTE</font> that this section <a href="#updates">has been updated</a> from this original proposal.
<P>

<H4>2.6 Why isn't this need met by existing specifications?</H4>

<P>Existing JSRs are either low-level (such as JSR-180) or high-level but specific to a particular application (such as JSR-186/187). JSR-180 requires detailed SIP knowledge and focuses a lot on P2P SIP based communication. Additionally usage of JSR 180 for applications utilizing the IMS, can lead to security issues if IMS conventions are not observed by the application developer. A high-level API does not only minimize those security problems but also reduces the risk to affect the operational safety of the IMS by restricting applications to proper behavior. There is currently no Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> ME API which supports for PoC services. </P><font color="red">NOTE</font> that this section <a href="#updates">has been updated</a> from this original proposal.

<H4>2.7 Please give a short description of the underlying technology or technologies:</H4>

<P>IMS is a multimedia platform for packet-oriented access networks such as UMTS, EDGE, GPRS or W-LAN standardized by the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project). It enables mobile operators to offer numerous voice, multimedia and data services based on IP (Internet Protocol), SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) and 3GPP Release 5. An IMS subscriber can make use of a whole host of interaction and communication options - from games for the entertainment sector to business applications - with a single login. IMS offers a variety of basic network services, such as session control services (including registration, routing and roaming), secure authentication, flexible charging and payment, quality of service, presence and Push-to-Talk over Cellular.<BR>
PoC, defined originally by an industry consortium (Motorola, Ericsson, Nokia, Siemens and AT&T Wireless), is a service that can be based on IMS. The resulting specifications of the consortium have been submitted to OMA to create a well accepted standard out of it. This has happened in the meanwhile and OMA has published the first version of the specification for the OMA PoC service (OMA PoC enabler release V1.0). It allows participants of PoC sessions to exchange talk bursts (half-duplex audio streams). The approach it is based upon, is comparable to walkie-talkies with enhanced functionality like group management, talk burst control and support for multiple simultaneous PoC sessions. <BR>
GLM is an enabling service for the IMS that can also be used in combination with non-IMS systems (currently only Wireless Village known). GLM is a standard defined by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA).The GLM API part offers a wide range of functionality to manage public groups of users as well as the user's personal profile and his contact lists. Group and list management uses a communication protocol that is based upon XML and HTTP (see XCAP - "The Extensible Markup Language (XML) Configuration Access protocol (XCAP)", J. Rosenberg, October 22, 2004, URL: <a href+"http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-simple-xcap-04.txt"> http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-simple-xcap-04.txt</a> ).

<H4>2.8 Is there a proposed package name for the API Specification? (i.e., <TT>javapi.something</TT>, <TT>org.something</TT>, etc.)</H4>

<P>javax.microedition.ims</P>

<H4>2.9 Does the proposed specification have any dependencies on specific operating systems, CPUs, or I/O devices that you know of?</H4>

<P>No</P>

<H4>2.10 Are there any security issues that cannot be addressed by the current security model?</H4>

<P>No. The platform that this API is implemented upon needs to have a security framework that can be used to enforce the appropriate policy. Defining the security framework is out of the scope for this JSR. For example, the MIDP 2.0 security framework can be re-used. In addition, the applications can rely on the security mechanisms provided by the IMS system (e.g. authentication) but this has to be supported by the underlying implementation.


</P>

<H4>2.11 Are there any internationalization or localization issues?</H4>

<P>No</P>

<H4>2.12 Are there any existing specifications that might be rendered obsolete, deprecated, or in need of revision as a result of this work?</H4>

<P>No</P>

<H4>2.13 Please describe the anticipated schedule for the development of this
specification.</H4>

<P>Expert Group formation:  Q3 2005<BR>
Early Draft: Q1 2006<BR>

</P>

<H4>2.14 Please describe the anticipated working model for the Expert Group working on developing this
specification.</H4>

<P>This group will conduct its work similar to other expert groups, utilizing email lists, frequent telephone conferences, and face-to-face meetings approximately every 6-8 weeks. Decisions will be made by technical consensus of the EG members.


</P>

<H4>2.15 It is important to the success of the community and each JSR that the work of the Expert Group be handled in a manner which provides the community and the public with insight into the work the Expert Group is doing, and the decisions that the Expert Group has made. The Executive Committees would like to ensure Spec Leads understand the value of this transparency and ask that each JSR have an operating plan in place for how their JSR will address the involvement of the community and the public. Please provide your plan here, and refer to the Spec Lead Guide for a more detailed description and a set of example questions you may wish to answer in your plan.</H4>

<P>- Provide an interim version of the specification to the community at least once a month<BR>
- Publish meeting minutes and open issues in the JSR observer alias<BR>
- Publish news and open a mailing list if necessary<BR>
- Maintain an Observer interest list for JCP members outside of the Expert Group (EG). Observers may follow the progress of the JSR by the periodic short briefs about the progress of the remaining open issues and specification drafts created by this JSR, as will be decided by the Expert Group. However, Observers will not be entitled to participate in the Expert Group meetings (face-to-face or telephone conferences). The Expert Group may also use the list to request feedback on key issues facing the group.<BR>
- Provide on a quarterly basis a brief JSR status to the JCP PMO, for publication to the Java community. This will include the current schedule for the JSR and notes on any major events that have occurred in the previous quarter.
