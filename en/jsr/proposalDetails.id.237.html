<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">Section 2: Request</FONT><P>
</P>

<H4>2.1 Please describe the proposed Specification:</H4>

<P>The Work Manager for Application Servers specification will contain an API that provides a simple, container-manageable programming model for concurrent execution of work. These work items execute out of a thread pool managed by a container. The Work Manager API provides a higher level of abstraction for concurrent programming than java.lang.Thread, which is inappropriate for use by applications hosted in managed environments such as EJB containers and Servlet containers.<P>

This API can be used within any environment, but is specifically designed for the requirements of managed environments.<P>

This specification does not require any changes to existing JavaTM 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) APIs or deployment descriptor formats. Components can access the work service through a lookup in the local Java environment in JNDI, provided the container supports this API and the application has been properly configured.



</P>

<H4>2.2 What is the target Java platform? (i.e., desktop, server, personal, embedded, card, etc.)</H4>

<P>Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition 1.4


</P>

<H4>2.3 What need of the Java community will be addressed by the proposed specification?</H4>

<P>There is commonly a need to perform application-level work concurrently. For example, a Servlet or JSP may need to pull data form several backend data sources or services before rendering HTML. This API will provide a means by which an application can specify the work that can be executed concurrently. It provides concurrency operations, including joining on two common conditions: all work items completing, and any of the work items completing.<P>

J2EE implementations commonly implement this functionality in vendor-specific ways, hindering application portability.



</P>

<H4>2.4 Why isn't this need met by existing specifications?</H4>

<P>There is presently no standard API for application-level concurrent programming within managed environments such as Servlets and EJBs. java.lang.Thread should not be used within these environments, and the JCA Work API is only appropriate for use within Resource Adapters.<P>

JSR-166 is targeted specifically at J2SE, and does not provide the proper interfaces for used within managed environments. However, alignment with base interfaces defined by JSR-166 may be possible. Also, JSR 166 is targeted at J2SE 1.5, this JSR targets a solution for J2EE 1.4.






</P>

<H4>2.5 Please give a short description of the underlying technology or technologies:</H4>

<P>This API can be implemented with existing Java APIs for concurrent programming, including java.lang.Thread or JSR-166.




</P>

<H4>2.6 Is there a proposed package name for the API Specification? (i.e., <TT>javapi.something</TT>, <TT>org.something</TT>, etc.)</H4>

<P>javax.work, javax.util, or javax.util.work

</P>

<H4>2.7 Does the proposed specification have any dependencies on specific operating systems, CPUs, or I/O devices that you know of?</H4>

<P>No</P>

<H4>2.8 Are there any security issues that cannot be addressed by the current security model?</H4>

<P>No</P>

<H4>2.9 Are there any internationalization or localization issues?</H4>

<P>No</P>

<H4>2.10 Are there any existing specifications that might be rendered obsolete, deprecated, or in need of revision as a result of this work?</H4>

<P>The J2EE Connector Architecture specification may consider using this specification as a base in the future, as it currently defines a work manager API specific to JCA.<P>

This API is meant to be complementary to JSR 166 (Concurrency Utilities for Java), as JSR 166 is primarily targeted at J2SE. It is possible that a follow-on to this JSR, or a follow-on to JSR-166, could rationalize these specifications.


</P>

<H4>2.11 Please describe the anticipated schedule for the development of this
specification.</H4>

<P>Winter 2003: Expert Group Formed<BR>
Spring 2004: Release Community Draft<BR>
Spring 2004: Release Public Review Draft<BR>
Summer 2004: Final Release


</P>

<H4>2.12 Please describe the anticipated working model for the Expert Group working on developing this
specification.</H4>

<P>E-mail, teleconferences, and infrequent face-to-face meetings. The environment of the expert group will be totally non-confidential. We will also use or create an open mailing list for discussions by other interested people outside the expert group. As the outbound licenses will be Royalty Free, expert group members  will need to ensure that their contributions are similarly made on that basis. Non-EG contributors to the mailing list will also be requested to provide that assurance. Precise details of the leadership processes of the expert group (for example: running calls, decision making, issue resolution) will be discussed by the leaders once the group?s size and dynamics are known.


</P>

<H4>2.13 Please describe how the RI and TCK will de delivered, i.e. as part of a profile or platform edition, or stand-alone, or both. Include version information for the profile or platform in your answer.
</H4>

<P>The RI and TCK will be made available in stand-alone form at the time of the final release. There will most likely be earlier versions of the RI and TCK that are developed as this JSR progresses.<P>

The RI will be generic to any particular container and not use any proprietary interfaces, and therefore should work with existing container implementations. <P>

IBM will be responsible for developing the TCK, although contributions from any Expert Group member would be welcome.<BR>
BEA will be responsible for developing the RI, although assistance from any Expert Group member would be welcome.





</P>

<H4>2.14 Please state the rationale if previous versions are available stand-alone and you are now proposing in 2.13 to only deliver RI and TCK as part of a profile or platform edition (See sections 1.1.5 and 1.1.6 of the JCP 2 document).
</H4>

<P>N/A</P>

<H4>2.15 Please provide a description of the business terms for the Specification, RI and TCK that will apply when this JSR is final.</H4>

<P>The Specification will be offered under royalty-free terms and thus be freely implementable. This license will comply with the terms defined by the JSPA. For an approximation of the Specification license, please see the license statements included in the specifications listed in section 3.1.<P>

The intention is to release the RI and TCK under licenses of a form of the draft licenses included as Exhibit A and Exhibit B in section 4.1, respectively. At this stage it is expected that IBM and BEA will strive to use a common license for the RI and similarly for the TCK.
