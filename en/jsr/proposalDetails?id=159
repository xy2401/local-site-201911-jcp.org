<H4>2.1 Please describe the proposed Specification:</h4>

<P>Overview:<P>

The Java Process Component (JPC) model will allow developers to directly represent a component as a service 
process that interacts via XML schema based events, produced and consumed through its typed ports. It will 
provide a facility for combining a group of process components into a collaboration that defines the linkage 
between their ports and their content types. It will also define a conversation mechanism that allows a 
developer to specify a stateful interaction sequence between ports.<P>

JPCs will allow developers to directly model event based services as individual components and collaborations. 
JPC will define both synchronous and asynchronous interaction modes. The JPC container will provide the 
infrastructure for life cycle management, transactions, security, content flow  and content transformation. In addition, JPC containers will
provide facilities for exposing JPCs and JPC collaborations as a web service and 
support the use of a web service within a JPC collaboration.<P>

An important goal of JPC is to enable visual tool based customization and composition of process components.<P>

Details:<P>

The goal of JPC is to provide J2EE developers with the ability to compose an application out of service level 
components (where service in this context means a loosely coupled, event based process). Today, J2EE 
developers build applications that implement a service; however, there is no formal way to describe the full 
semantics of a service to the J2EE container. There is no formal concept of a service as a J2EE component nor is 
there a formal concept of service composition.<P>

For some time, the computing industry has struggled to find a component abstraction that balanced the need 
for type safety with the need for loosely coupled, event based composition. The most recent and most promising 
solution to this problem is the EDOC Component Collaboration Architecture. In addition to standing alone as a service component
architecture, CCA is closely related to the WSDL model for web services. Both are loosely 
coupled, port based models of service integration; however, the CCA goes much further to explicitly define a rich collaboration model.
Their similarities make it practical to view WSDL as a web service adjunct to CCA 
rather than a different, competing technology.<P>

Rather than inventing yet another service component model, JPC will be based on the existing EDOC Component Collaboration
Architecture. While JPC will draw on EDOC concepts and design, EDOC neither constrains nor defines requirements for JPC.<P>

JPC will define a programming model for process components composed of developer APIs; deployment 
descriptors and container contracts.<P>

The JPC model will be fully recursive. That is, a collaboration of JPCs will appear externally as a JPC and can 
itself be used as an element of a further collaboration.<P>

The scope of a collaboration will likely be limited to JPCs within a JPC container plus some form of proxy JPC 
that is a local proxy for a web service. Since the JPC container will have significantly less control over JPC web 
service proxies than over its local JPCs, collaboration with them will be more restricted than collaboration 
between local JPCs. JPC web service proxies may be generated automatically by JPC container tools or they may 
be developed manually using J2EE web service client facilities.<P>

The JPC container will provide facilities for exposing a JPC as a web service. Specifically, JAX-RPC and JAXM will be supported as
producers and consumers of JPC events. In some cases, a developer may choose to expose a 
JPC's ports directly as web service ports. In other cases, a JPC port may be exposed indirectly via a JPC port 
adapter.<P>

The web service model will be the distributed view of a JPC. JPC will be well poised to take advantage of 
distribution optimizations of this model as they are defined by the web service community. J2EE may also define optimizations that apply
only within the J2EE community. Both forms of optimization will be transparent 
to JPC's.<P>

JPCs will not obsolete the existing J2EE component models - JSPs, Servlets and EJBs. These models will continue 
to be the basic building blocks of J2EE applications. The JPC component model will provide a mechanism for 
layering a process level abstraction over these components. In effect, it will be a way to aggregate a combination 
of JSPs, Servlets and EJBs to form a process level component. This means that JPC will introduce a minimum of 
new programming concepts and will focus primarily on the 'binding' of a process definition to its implementation as J2EE components.<P>

It is a primary goal of JPC to simplify the development of web services. It is also a primary goal to provide 
enhanced collaboration of service components when they are used locally within a JPC container. In order to 
achieve both goals, the JPC web service binding must be a first class element of the JPC model and it must be clear to developers how
to maximize both the web service level collaboration potential and the JPC collaboration potential of their components. The goal is to
define the JPC model as the 'future' of web services and to incrementally to expose more of it as web services evolve to support a richer
collaboration architecture.<P>

The JPC model is based on an event driven service concept. A JPC defines its function in terms of input and 
output ports and the content that flows through them. This model simplifies adapting a JPC to fulfill multiple 
roles. The JPC container enables this style of development by injecting the plumbing for composing JPCs as 
opposed to building plumbing dependencies into a JPC. For instance, the JPC container will provide a reliable handoff between
asychronously coupled JPCs without exposing the mechanism this requires. This injected 
plumbing simplifies creating a JPC and makes it easier to customize/compose its function.<P>

The JPC model will close part of the gap between existing  J2EE components and workflow/business process 
functionality; however, JPCs will not, on their own, provide such functionality. The JPC collaboration mechanism is focused primarily on
constructing a service within an atomic transaction. It will also provide basic support for longer running conversations between services
but these will be focused more on the mechanics of a 
conversation and less on the larger issues of enterprise wide choreography of business processes. It is expected 
that many workflow/business process products will provide orchestration facilities for JPCs, either as extended 
functionality of the JPC container itself or by orchestrating JPCs that are made available as web services.

<H4>2.2 What is the target Java platform? (i.e., desktop, server, personal, embedded, card, etc.)</h4>

<P>J2EE</p>

<H4>2.3 What need of the Java community will be addressed by the proposed specification?</h4>

<P>IThe JPC model will allow J2EE developers to formally model and implement a service level abstraction as a J2EE 
component. This enhances the J2EE platform because it allows the platform to directly capture the semantics of 
the services that are the goal of the J2EE developer. This gives the J2EE container significantly more leverage to 
simplify the implementation, assembly, deployment and execution of a service.

</p>

<H4>2.4 Why isn't this need met by existing specifications?</h4>

<P>No current J2EE specification defines a process component model.</p>

<H4>2.5 Please give a short description of the underlying technology or technologies:</h4>

<P>This JSR builds on the facilities provided by the J2EE 1.4 Platform JSR and is intended to be included in a future version of the J2EE Platform.
It will utilize the existing component models defined in J2EE.<P>

<H4>3.2 Explanation of how these items might be used as a starting point for the work.</h4>

<P>XML Schema definition will be used to describe JPC event types. J2EE APIs provide the platform definition on 
which JPC will add functionality. EDOC CCA defines the conceptual model for process components and 
collaborations. This model will be a primary input to the JPC work; however, it neither constrains nor defines 
requirements for JPC. WSDL is the current standard for describing a web service. JAXP and JAXB provide the 
functionality that JPCs use to work with the event content they produce and consume.  XPath and XSLT may be 
used in a JPC collaboration to provide the content transformation needed to integrate content exchange 
between components. JAX-RPC, JAXM and JAXR will be used to both to expose JPCs as a web service and to 
create the JPC proxies needed to include a web service within a JPC collaboration. JSR 109 will define J2EE web 
service bindings and packaging. Tools support for JPC is critical and the JMI API for the MOF metadata facility is 
technology that will help speed the development of JPC tools. JPC components may need to exchange security 
assertions between themselves and with the outside world of web services, if so, JSR 155 will define that 
exchange.
