<!-- SECTION 2 -->

<A NAME="2"></A>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">Section 2: Request</FONT><P>
</P>

<H4>2.1 Please describe the proposed Specification:</H4>

<P>The PM API specification is the network-facing API. The network-facing PM API will interface element managers, and/or system managers and/or or sub-network managers that provide performance information. 
<p>
Within the APIs that have been defined by the OSS through Java Initiative, the performance management functionality is embedded within the OSS Quality of Service API.  The PM JSR is the second of two JSRs (please see <A HREF="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=263">JSR 263</A>) to separate the fault and performance management functionality from the OSS Quality of Service API.  This JSR will provide for a standalone (without embedded FM functionality) performance measurement and thresholding API (Performance Management).
<p>
The specification that would be produced by this JSR would start by lifting the existing PM functionality for the OSS Quality of Service API, and then update that functionality based on requests received from the community since the first release of the OSS Quality of Service API as well as adding additional functionality to make the resulting API aligned with the 3GPP Release 6 Performance Management Reference Point (IRP) specifications.  When (and if) existing operations within the PM interfaces from JSR 90 are identified as no longer being needed, such operations will be deprecated rather than removed. </P>

<H4>2.2 What is the target Java platform? (i.e., desktop, server, personal, embedded, card, etc.)</H4>

<P>Server. 
<p>
The target Java platform is J2EE running in an OSS, NMS, or EMS.  (Operations Support System, Network Management System and Element Management System respectively).



</P>

<H4>2.3 The Executive Committees would like to ensure JSR submitters think about how their proposed technology relates to all of the Java platform editions. Please provide details here for which platform editions are being targeted by this JSR, and how this JSR has considered the relationship with the other platform editions.</H4>

<P>The target platform is Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition. The Performance Management API is developed consistently with <A HREF="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=144">JSR 144</A> and the other APIs developed by the OSS through Java Initiative and works smoothly with them.
<p>
This specification being requested by this JSR provides for performance management within an information/telecom communications network utilizing J2EE technology.  There is no apparent overlap or impact on other platform editions.



</P>

<H4>2.4 Should this JSR be voted on by both Executive Committees?</H4>

<P>The initiating companies do not believe that voting by both Executive Committees is required.  A vote by the J2SE/J2EE EC is appropriate.</P>


<H4>2.5 What need of the Java community will be addressed by the proposed specification?</H4>

<P>Currently, if an OSS/NMS/EMS vendor wants to implement performance   management functionality using the OSS/J APIs/Design Guidelines, they must implement some portion of the OSS Quality of Service alarm monitoring functionality in order to be OSS/J compliant/certified.  This JSR will enable a vendor to only implement the functionality related to performance management and provide a more coherent component model for the OSS through Java API set.  Current users/implementers of the existing JSR-90 OSS QoS API will be able to continue using the QoS API for as long as they wish.  With the initiation of this JSR, those individuals or organizations using the QoS API will have a straight forward migration path to implement the newer FM and PM APIs, using their existing code bases.  A complete rewrite will not be needed.</P>

<H4>2.6 Why isn't this need met by existing specifications?</H4>

<P>As noted above, the performance management functionality is currently embedded within the OSS Quality of Service API. For the developers of stand alone performance management applications, it will be more natural and straightforward to use only this JSR. </P>

<H4>2.7 Please give a short description of the underlying technology or technologies:</H4>

<P>The Performance Management API will be defined as a J2EE API that is compliant with the OSS through Java? Design Guidelines and implemented as an extension of the OSS Common API (<A HREF="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=144">JSR 144</A>).  The Key J2SE/J2EE platform APIs for the FM API will be the following: 
<UL>
<LI>CBE (Core Business Entities)
Value object representing Events and Alarms will be modelled according to the  CBE (included in JSR 144) 
<LI>EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans):
To facilitate the integration of OSS components, the expert group will define standard EJB interfaces.
<LI>JMS (Java Message Service):
Besides the ability to execute synchronous (EJB) methods calls, there is also a need to send asynchronous messages. For this, JMS will be used. 
<LI>JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface):
The specification will include standards for JNDI names based on the  CBE definitions
<LI>XML:
There will be an XML over JMS binding for the API that enables clients to interact with an API implementation via the Java? Message Service
<LI>Web Services:
There will be a Web Services binding for the API that enables web based applications to interact with an API implementation via Web Services.
</UL></P>

<H4>2.8 Is there a proposed package name for the API Specification? (i.e., <TT>javapi.something</TT>, <TT>org.something</TT>, etc.)</H4>

<P>The API will have one or several packages and the prefix for all packages will be "javax.oss". The remaining part of the package name will be defined according to a logical name for different parts of the API. Package names of all OSS JSRs will be coordinated to avoid ambiguous use.
<p>
The base package will be "javax.oss.performance".</P>

<H4>2.9 Does the proposed specification have any dependencies on specific operating systems, CPUs, or I/O devices that you know of?</H4>

<P>There are no known dependencies on specific devices, operating systems, etc within the specification.</P>

<H4>2.10 Are there any security issues that cannot be addressed by the current security model?</H4>

<P>The existing J2EE platform security model is sufficient for the proposed API and implementations of that API.


</P>

<H4>2.11 Are there any internationalization or localization issues?</H4>

<P>There are no known internationalisation or localization issues within the API itself.  The RI will provide a resource bundle for exception messages in the English language.  The TCK will be delivered in English language only.


</P>

<H4>2.12 Are there any existing specifications that might be rendered obsolete, deprecated, or in need of revision as a result of this work?</H4>

<P>Not directly; however the JSR 90: OSS Quality of Service API will be deprecated once the second related JSR (Performance Measurement and Thresholding) is completed.  Even in light of the second API the existing OSS Quality of Service API can continue to be used.</P>

<H4>2.13 Please describe the anticipated schedule for the development of this
specification.</H4>

<P><P><UL>
<LI>2006-01 Expert Group Formation and Expansion
<LI>2006-04 Early Draft Review
<LI>2006-06 Public Review
<LI>2006-09 Proposed Final Draft
<LI>2006-12 Final Release 
</UL></P>

<H4>2.14 Please describe the anticipated working model for the Expert Group working on developing this
specification.</H4>

<P>In the past, OSS through Java Expert Groups have had membership from a geographically diverse set community members.  In order to facilitate communications and minimize travel expenses for participants, the expert group will accomplish the vast majority of its work via conference calls and a dedicated mailing list.

The Expert Group will start work from the existing OSS Quality of Service API specification, the release 6 3GPP Performance Management IRP, the latest version of the OSS Common API (including the OSS CBE) and the OSS through Java Design Guidelines.
<p>
The Expert Group will work via consensus, and where consensus cannot be reached a formal vote via email will be taken with a simple majority needed to carry the vote.
<p>  
The Performance Management project plan is accountable to OSS/J project plan, which is currently maintained by the OSS/J Product Team.



</P>

<H4>2.15 It is important to the success of the community and each JSR that the work of the Expert Group be handled in a manner which provides the community and the public with insight into the work the Expert Group is doing, and the decisions that the Expert Group has made. The Executive Committees would like to ensure Spec Leads understand the value of this transparency and ask that each JSR have an operating plan in place for how their JSR will address the involvement of the community and the public. Please provide your plan here, and refer to the Spec Lead Guide for a more detailed description and a set of example questions you may wish to answer in your plan.</H4>

<P>Progress updates will be provided on the OSS/J main <A HREF="http://www.ossj.org/">web site</A>.  The OSS/J leads have initiated efforts to provide more information to the public through projects on java.net.   Performance Management will follow the policies and practices of the OSS/J Initiative.
<p>
In May 2004, the OSS/J technology has been formally endorsed by the TeleManagement Forum () has the first technology specific implementation of NGOSS standards. Some elements of the NGOSS standards are themselves referenced by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) as de-jure ITU recommendations. The scope and progress of this JSR will therefore also be reported to the telecommunication industry through TMF, ITU and other standard bodies such as 3GPP, OMA, OMG. In addition the OSS/J Initiative reports progress of its work at various industry conferences and with its own public seminars, on line seminars and workshops. The progress of the API will be kept current on the JSR specific web page(s) provided by and hosted on the Java Community Process Website. </P>

<H4>2.16 Please describe how the RI and TCK will de delivered, i.e. as part of a profile or platform edition, or stand-alone, or both. Include version information for the profile or platform in your answer.
</H4>

<P>The Performance Management RI and TCK will be delivered as stand alone packages, under the same licensing model and certification model as all other OSS/J APIs. If, by the time of release, a decision is made to include OSS/J APIs as part of the J2SE/J2EE platform, the RI and TCK may be delivered as part of the J2SE/J2EE platform edition, with the agreement of the OSS through Java <sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> membership and the expert group membership.</P>

<H4>2.17 Please state the rationale if previous versions are available stand-alone and you are now proposing in 2.13 to only deliver RI and TCK as part of a profile or platform edition (See sections 1.1.5 and 1.1.6 of the JCP 2 document).
</H4>

<P>Not applicable.</P>

<H4>2.18 Please provide a description of the business terms for the Specification, RI and TCK that will apply when this JSR is final.</H4>

<P>The Performance Management API will be made available to the public under the same terms and conditions as all other OSS/J APIs, which is called the OSS/J Harmonized Licensing and Certification Model. The agreements for the Specifications, the Reference Implementations and the TCKs can be viewed by <A HREF="http://ossj.org/downloads/api.shtml">downloading any OSS/J API</A>.

<H4>3.2 Explanation of how these items might be used as a starting point for the work.</H4>

<P>As explained above, this JSR intends to separate the performance management functionality from the JSR90: OSS QoS API into a standalone API therefore the existing QoS API specification will be used as the basis for the work.  This JSR will also examine the 3GPP Release 6 Performance Management IRPs and make any necessary changes to ensure compatibility.</P>
