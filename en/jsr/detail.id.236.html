</P>

<H4>2.1 Please describe the proposed Specification:</H4>

<P>The Concurrency Utilities for Java EE provides asynchronous capabilities to Java EE application components, largely through extending the Concurrency Utilities API developed under JSR-166.
<P>
Java<font size="-2"><sup>TM</sup></font> Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) server containers such as the enterprise bean or web component container do not allow using common Java SE concurrency APIs such as java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor, java.lang.Thread,java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor or java.util.Timer directly.
<P>
The server containers provide runtime support for Java EE application components (such as servlets and Enterprise JavaBeans<font size="-2"><sup>TM</sup></font> (EJB<font size="-2"><sup>TM</sup></font>)). They provide a layer between application component code and platform services and resources. All application component code is run on a thread managed by a container and each container typically expects all access to container-supplied objects to occur on the same thread.<P>

It is because of this behavior that application components are typically unable to reliably use other Java EE platform services from a thread that is not managed by the container. Java EE Product Providers (see chapter 2.11 of the Java Platform Enterprise Edition Specification) also discourage the use of resources in a non-managed way, because it can potentially undermine the enterprise features that the platform is designed to provide such as availability, security, and reliability and scalability.<P>

When used within managed environments, this API is a much better alternative to existing Java SE APIs:<P>

java.util.Timer, java.lang.Thread and the thread pool creation APIs from the Java SE concurrency utilities (JSR-166) in the java.util.concurrent package should never be used within managed environments, as it creates threads outside the purview of the container. . <BR>
javax.management.timer.Timer is tightly coupled with the JMX framework and does not provide a
sufficiently user-friendly or independent API.<P>


The Concurrency Utilities for Java EE specification thus provides a clean, simple, independent API by building on JSR-166, making it appropriate for use within any Java EE container. </P>

<H4>2.2 What is the target Java platform? (i.e., desktop, server, personal, embedded, card, etc.)</H4>

<P>Java<font size="-2"><sup>TM</sup></font> Platform, Enterprise Edition 7 (Java EE 7)</P>

<H4>2.3 The Executive Committees would like to ensure JSR submitters think about how their proposed technology relates to all of the Java platform editions. Please provide details here for which platform editions are being targeted by this JSR, and how this JSR has considered the relationship with the other platform editions.</H4>

<P>This specification is targeted for Java EE 7 Platform. It extends the custom execution framework in JSR 166: Concurrent Utilities in Java SE platform making them suitable for use in Java EE platform.</P>

<H4>2.4 Should this JSR be voted on by both Executive Committees?</H4>

<P>No. Just the SE/EE Executive Committee</P>


<H4>2.5 What need of the Java community will be addressed by the proposed specification?</H4>

<P>There is commonly a need to perform application-level work concurrently or periodically using different threads of execution. For example, a Servlet or JSP may need to pull data from several back end data sources or services before rendering HTML. This API will provide a means by which an application can specify the work that can be executed concurrently. Java EE implementations commonly implement this functionality in vendor-specific ways, hindering application portability.</P>

<H4>2.6 Why isn't this need met by existing specifications?</H4>

<P>There is presently no standard API for application-level concurrent programming within managed environments such as Servlets and EJBs. java.lang.Thread, java.util.Timer and thread pool creation APIs from JSR-166 should not be used within these environments, and the JCA WorkManager API is only appropriate for use within Resource Adapters.</P>

<H4>2.7 Please give a short description of the underlying technology or technologies:</H4>

<P>This API can be implemented with existing Java APIs for concurrent programming, including JSR-166.
</P>

<H4>2.8 Is there a proposed package name for the API Specification? (i.e., <TT>javapi.something</TT>, <TT>org.something</TT>, etc.)</H4>

<P>javax.enterprise.concurrent</P>

<H4>2.13 Please describe the anticipated schedule for the development of this
specification.</H4>

Q3 2012: Release Community Draft<BR>
Q4 2012: Release Public Review Draft<BR>

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.<P>

Exhibit B<P>

NOTE: participants in this expert group must sign a supplemental license agreement to enable an external specification, which has already been published with royalty free patent grants for essential claims, to remain in sync with any enhancements done by the expert group while the expert group completes its work. To that end, the supplemental agreement changes the timing of some of the IP grants that EG members must make. The agreement may be downloaded <a href="/aboutJava/communityprocess/JCP_SCLA.pdf">here</a>.

<!-- SECTION 2 -->

<A NAME="2"></A>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">Section 2: Request</FONT><P>
</P>

<H4>2.1 Please describe the proposed Specification:</H4>

<P>The Timer API for Application Servers provides a Timer API for use within managed environments such as application servers conforming to JavaTM 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE), within components such as Servlets, EJBs, and JCA Resource Adapters. The Timer API enables applications to schedule timer and receive timer notification callbacks with an application-specified listener.<P>

When with managed environments, this API is a much better alternative to java.util.Timer and the JMX Timer, the two standardized APIs in Java:<P>
<ul>
 * java.util.Timer should never be used within managed environments, as it creates threads outside the purview of the container. Further, there is no clean way of subclassing java.util.Timer to avoid thread creation, as all constructors create and start a thread.<P>

 * The JMX Timer is tightly coupled with the JMX framework and does not provide a sufficiently user-friendly or independent API.</ul><P>

The J2EE Timer thus provides a clean, simple, independent API that is appropriate for use within any J2EE container.
</P>

<H4>2.2 What is the target Java platform? (i.e., desktop, server, personal, embedded, card, etc.)</H4>

<P>Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition 1.4


</P>

<H4>2.3 What need of the Java community will be addressed by the proposed specification?</H4>

<P>There is currently no standard timer API appropriate for use within managed environments. Today, J2EE vendors commonly implement this functionality in vendor-specific ways, hindering application portability.




</P>

<H4>2.4 Why isn't this need met by existing specifications?</H4>

<P>java.util.Timer cannot be used within managed environments because it creates and starts threads outside the purview of the container. Furthermore, it cannot be subclassed in an acceptable fashion such that a thread is not created in the java.util.Timer constructors.




</P>

<H4>2.5 Please give a short description of the underlying technology or technologies:</H4>

<P>Timers are well-understood and widely implemented technology.


</P>

<H4>2.6 Is there a proposed package name for the API Specification? (i.e., <TT>javapi.something</TT>, <TT>org.something</TT>, etc.)</H4>

<P>javax.timer, javax.util, or javax.util.timer


</P>

<H4>2.7 Does the proposed specification have any dependencies on specific operating systems, CPUs, or I/O devices that you know of?</H4>

<P>No</P>

<H4>2.8 Are there any security issues that cannot be addressed by the current security model?</H4>

<P>No</P>

<H4>2.9 Are there any internationalization or localization issues?</H4>

<P>No</P>

<H4>2.10 Are there any existing specifications that might be rendered obsolete, deprecated, or in need of revision as a result of this work?</H4>

<P>The J2EE Connector Architecture Specification, version 1.5 should be modified in the future to use this specification rather than improperly using java.util.Timer.</P>

<H4>2.11 Please describe the anticipated schedule for the development of this
specification.</H4>

<P>Winter 2003: Expert Group Formed<BR>
Spring 2004: Release Community Draft<BR>
Spring 2004: Release Public Review Draft<BR>
Summer 2004: Final Release<P>
Because this is a small API, we believe this rapid schedule should be achievable.</P>

<H4>2.12 Please describe the anticipated working model for the Expert Group working on developing this
specification.</H4>

<P>E-mail, teleconferences, and infrequent face-to-face meetings. The environment of the expert group will be totally non-confidential. We will also use or create an open mailing list for discussions by other interested people outside the expert group. As the outbound licenses will be Royalty Free, expert group members  will need to ensure that their contributions are similarly made on that basis. Non-EG contributors to the mailing list will also be requested to provide that assurance. Precise details of the leadership processes of the expert group (for example: running calls, decision making, issue resolution) will be discussed by the leaders once the group's size and dynamics are known.

</P>

<H4>2.13 Please describe how the RI and TCK will de delivered, i.e. as part of a profile or platform edition, or stand-alone, or both. Include version information for the profile or platform in your answer.
</H4>

<P>The RI and TCK will be made available in stand-alone form at the time of the final release. There will most likely be earlier versions of the RI and TCK that are developed as this JSR progresses.<P>

The RI will be generic to any particular container and not use any proprietary interfaces, and therefore should work with existing container implementations. <P>

IBM will be responsible for developing the TCK, although contributions from any Expert Group member would be welcome.

</P>

<H4>2.14 Please state the rationale if previous versions are available stand-alone and you are now proposing in 2.13 to only deliver RI and TCK as part of a profile or platform edition (See sections 1.1.5 and 1.1.6 of the JCP 2 document).
</H4>

<P>N/A</P>

<H4>2.15 Please provide a description of the business terms for the Specification, RI and TCK that will apply when this JSR is final.</H4>

<P>The Specification will be offered under royalty-free terms and thus be freely implementable. This license will comply with the terms defined by the JSPA. For an approximation of the Specification license, please see the license statements included in the specifications listed in section 3.1.<P>

The intention is to release the RI and TCK under licenses of a form of the draft licenses included as Exhibit A and Exhibit B in section 4.1, respectively. At this stage it is expected that IBM and BEA will strive to use a common license for the RI and similarly for the TCK.
