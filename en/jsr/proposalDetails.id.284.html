<H4>2.1 Please describe the proposed Specification:</H4>

<P>Software  systems  in  many  circumstances  need  awareness  of  their
resource usage.   Meeting performance requirements  often requires the
ability   to  manage   consumption  of   resources  provided   by  the
environment.    Resource  management   is  traditionally   handled  by
operating systems,  but the growing need  to use the  Java platform in
the  systems programming domain  adds increased  pressure to  equip it
with resource  management capabilities at a level  of abstraction that
fits gracefully with the language.<p>

Preventing denial  of service  attacks, providing load  balancing, and
monitoring the  usage of a given  resource are all difficult  to do in
the current version of the Java platform.  In general, these and other
features  cannot be provided  without going  beyond the  Java language
proper, through mechanisms  such as native code or  shell scripts that
ask the OS to handle matters related to resource management.  The lack
of a  standard, programmatic way  to partition resources  available to
virtual  machine(s) among  Java applications  has led  to a  number of
ad-hoc solutions.<p>

The Resource  Management API for J2SE Applications  should address the
above and be characterized by the following:<p>

<ul>

<li>Wide applicability.  The interface should be applicable to a variety
  of  resource  management  scenarios  and  allow  the  expression  of
  numerous resource management policies.
</li>

<li>Flexibility.  The interface should enable managing a  broad range of
  resource types.  For example,  for some  applications resources such
  as  the  CPU  time  and  heap   memory  matter   most,  while  other
  applications  may  find  it  more meaningful  to manage higher-level
  resources, such as the number of open JDBC connections or the number
  of  transactions  per  second, and  the API  should accommodate this
  entire spectrum.
</li>

<li>Extensibility.  The resource management interface should support the
  addition of new resources in a uniform manner.</li>

<li>Completeness  of  abstraction.    The  interface  should  hide  from
  applications whether a given resource  is managed  by the underlying
  operating system (OS), by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM),  by a core
  library, or by trusted middleware code.  As a consequence, it should
  be  possible  to  write  resource policies  for resources exhibiting
  common behavior abstractly, without  regard for  how those resources
  are implemented.
</li>

<li>Lack  of  specialization.    The  interface  should  not  require an
  implementation to depend on specialized support  from an  OS or from
  hardware, although implementations should be free  to take advantage
  of such support if available.
</li>

<li>Ease  of  exposing  resources  through  the  API  in  a low-overhead
  fashion.
</li>

<li>Diagnosability.  It should be  straightforward to determine cause(s)
  of an application running into resource constraints.
</li>

<li>Simplicity of use.  While excercising  the full power of the API may
  require  expert  knowledge,  it should  be simple  to perform common
  resource management tasks.
</li>

</ul>

Concrete examples  are  given  below to  demonstrate the  need for and
usefulness of  the  proposed  specification.    None  of  them  can be
realized by current APIs.<p>

<ul>

<li> An  application  management  environment  needs   to  confine  each
   application to at most 32MB of heap memory and would like to detect
   applications  that  use  more  than  90%  of  CPU time  in order to
   terminate  them.    Moreover,  a minimal  quantity of  heap and CPU
   should be reserved for each application to ensure a  basic level of
   service.
</li>

<li> An application would like to be notified when its  usage of network
   resources exceedes 10MB/s,  so that  it can  start compressing data
   before sending it, but only  if the  total CPU  time consumption is
   below 50% (effectively  this policy  is about  trading one resource
   for another).
</li>

<li> A  service  provider  would  like  to understand  (for profiling or
   billing purposes) how  much of  each resource  of interest (memory,
   CPU  time,  SQL statements  submitted over  JDBC connections, etc.)
   each user is consuming.
</li>

<li> A  service provider  would like  to distinguish  between users with
   "platinum", "gold", and "silver" contracts and offer them different
   QoS  level.  This translates into  the need  to partition resources
   according to the contractually agreed upon QoS.
</li>

</ul>

The API should enable resource  management policies  to be programmed.
In particular, such a policy should have the ability to define when an
application may  gain  access  to,  or consume,  a unit  of a specific
resource.  It should be possible  to bind  computations dynamically to
policies.  Programs should be able to reserve resources in advance and
thus ensure  predictable  execution.   Applications should  be able to
install resource  monitoring  code  so  that  proactive  programs  can
observe resource availability and take any actions  required to ensure
performance and availability or to ward off denial of service attacks.
Existing applications  should  run  without modification,  even if the
Java platform  classes  or  the Java  runtime environment  they depend
depend on exploits the resource  management framework.   The interface
should not   impact   in  any   way  how   actual  resource  providers
(schedulers, automatic memory subsystems, etc.)   should  be written -
it should be possible to make  these providers  become "RM-enabled" by
inserting calls to appropriate API methods to convey information about
resource consumption  attempts.    The  effort  required  to  retrofit
existing resource managers should thus be minimized.<p>

The specification  will build upon  the abstraction of an  isolate, as
defined in  JSR 121.   An isolate is  an encapsulated Java  program or
application  component  that  shares  no state  with  other  isolates.
Isolates  are a convenient  abstraction on  which to  develop resource
management: isolation allows unambiguous resource usage accounting and
clean  reclamation upon  program termination.   The expert  group will
also look  at enabling  the API  to operate on  platforms that  do not
support the Isolate  API. In particular, a single  JVM could be viewed
as a special case of a single isolate.<p>

In  addition to defining  an API,  which will  be a  framework through
which  resources  can  be  uniformly  exposed to  client  programs  as
entities subject to management, the outcome of this JSR will include a
non-empty  set of  resources deemed  core and  required  by compatible
implementations.<p></P>

<H4>2.2 What is the target Java platform? (i.e., desktop, server, personal, embedded, card, etc.)</H4>

<P>Java SE</P>

<H4>2.3 The Executive Committees would like to ensure JSR submitters think about how their proposed technology relates to all of the Java platform editions. Please provide details here for which platform editions are being targeted by this JSR, and how this JSR has considered the relationship with the other platform editions.</H4>

<P>This JSR is submitted to the Java SE EC.
It is likely that this functionality will be used by Java EE as well.</P>

<h4>Should this JSR be voted on by both Executive Committees?</H4>

<P>No.</P>

<H4>2.5 What need of the Java community will be addressed by the proposed specification?</H4>

<P>Inability to manage computational resources, to impose constraints on Java applications, to reserve quantities of resources so that Java applications can have predictable performance, and to provide means of querying about resource availability.</P>

<H4>2.6 Why isn't this need met by existing specifications?</H4>

<P>The existing specifications haven't addressed this problem yet. Several specifications allow for some for of monitoring of a specific resource, but these are isolated cases. There is a lack of a uniform and comprehensive approach.<p>

We duly  note the existence and  usefulness of the  JSR 174.  However,
its  scope -  monitoring the  health of  the JVM  as well  as exposing
certain  JVM-wide statistics  -  is different  from  the goals  stated
above.   For example,  JSR 174  cannot asist  in  reserving resources,
constraining  their usage, and  partitioning their  availability among
Java applications.<p>

Another related technology  is the JMX API (JSR 3,  JSR 160, JSR 255).
We view the proposed specification as complementary to the JMX API, as
it provides  missing controls and  functionality that can  be inserted
into the framework defined by the JMX API.<p>

The OSS  technology JSRs (in particular  90, 210) are  also related as
they  may be clients  of the  low-level functionality  and information
provided by this JSR.<p>

The  Java  Platform  Profiling   Architecture  (JSR  163)  allows  for
gathering   information  about   various   low-level  events   (object
construction, method  invocation, etc).  The API,  expressed in C/C++,
is meant to  be a building block for  tools (profilers, debuggers) and
does  not provide  the functionality  requested in  this  proposal and
exposes  limited  information only  about  a  small,  fixed number  of
resources.  However,  simple proof-of-concept implementations  of some
resources could use JSR 163 to gather usage information.<p>

Finally, there  is the recently  started JSR 278  (Resource Management
Framework for  J2ME).  Its scope,  despite the name, is  much narrower
than what's proposed above.  In  essence 278 aims at determining which
applications (actually their intent is to encapsulate each application
within an isolate)  excessively use certain types of  resources and to
reclaim these resources upon (forced) termination of certain apps.  In
particular,  there  is  no  provision  for  application-level  (self-)
monitoring, expressing notifications, constraints, and reservations.<p></P>

<H4>2.7 Please give a short description of the underlying technology or technologies:</H4>

<P>Implementation details of exposing a resource through the API will depend on the resource's implementation. For some resources modifying core libraries will suffice, for others it may be necessary to modify the virtual machine code.
The rest of the API (the mechanics of setting constraints, reservations, notifications, etc) can be realized entirely in the Java programming language.</P>

<H4>2.8 Is there a proposed package name for the API Specification? (i.e., <TT>javapi.something</TT>, <TT>org.something</TT>, etc.)</H4>

<P>javax.rm</P>

<H4>2.9 Does the proposed specification have any dependencies on specific operating systems, CPUs, or I/O devices that you know of?</H4>

<P>No.</P>

<H4>2.10 Are there any security issues that cannot be addressed by the current security model?</H4>

<P>No.</P>

<H4>2.11 Are there any internationalization or localization issues?</H4>

<P>No.</P>

<H4>2.12 Are there any existing specifications that might be rendered obsolete, deprecated, or in need of revision as a result of this work?</H4>

<P>No.</P>

<H4>2.13 Please describe the anticipated schedule for the development of this 
specification.</H4>

<P>October 2005: EG formed.<BR>
October 2006: Specification complete.<BR>
December 2006: TCK, RI ready.</P>

<H4>2.14 Please describe the anticipated working model for the Expert Group working on developing this 
specification.</H4>

<P>A combination of e-mail and weekly phone meetings.</P>

<H4>2.15 It is important to the success of the community and each JSR that the work of the Expert Group be handled in a manner which provides the community and the public with insight into the work the Expert Group is doing, and the decisions that the Expert Group has made. The Executive Committees would like to ensure Spec Leads understand the value of this transparency and ask that each JSR have an operating plan in place for how their JSR will address the involvement of the community and the public. Please provide your plan here, and refer to the Spec Lead Guide for a more detailed description and a set of example questions you may wish to answer in your plan.</H4>

<P>Updates will be sent to the interest list set up for this JSR. The list will be archived and the members will be able to post questions to the EG.</P>


<H4>2.16 Please describe how the RI and TCK will de delivered, i.e. as part of a profile or platform edition, or stand-alone, or both. Include version information for the profile or platform in your answer.
</H4>

<P>Both the RI and the TCK will be delivered stand-alone.</P>

<H4>2.17 Please state the rationale if previous versions are available stand-alone and you are now proposing in 2.13 to only deliver RI and TCK as part of a profile or platform edition (See sections 1.1.5 and 1.1.6 of the JCP 2 document).
</H4>

<P>N/A</P>

<H4>2.18 Please provide a description of the business terms for the Specification, RI and TCK that will apply when this JSR is final.</H4>

<P>The RI for this JSR will be made available in binary form
at no charge. The TCK for this JSR will be made available
at no charge to J2SE TCK licensees and at $50K to others.
In addition, qualified individuals and not for profit
organizations will receive access to the TCK at no charge.</P>
