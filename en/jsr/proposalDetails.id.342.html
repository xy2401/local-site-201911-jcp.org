<B><U>2012.11.29</U></b>:<BR>
<a name="2.1"></a><H4>2.1 Please describe the proposed Specification:</H4><P>

This JSR is to develop Java EE 7, the next release of the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition.
<P>
The main focus of this release is on enhanced simplification,
productivity, and support for HTML 5.  Since its inception, the Java
EE platform has been targeted at offloading the developer from common
infrastructure tasks through its container-based model and abstraction
of resource access.  In recent releases the platform has considerably
simplified the APIs for access to container services while broadening
the range of the services available.  In this release we aim to
continue the direction of improved simplification, while extending the
range of the Java EE platform to encompass emerging technologies in
the web space.

<P>
- Latest web standards -
<P>
We expect the Java EE 7 platform to add first-class support for recent
developments in web standards, including HTML5, Web Sockets, and
JSON. It will also include a modern HTTP client API as defined by the
JAX-RS 2.0 JSR.
<P>
- Ease of development -
<P>
On the ease of development front, Java EE 7 will include a revised 
and greatly simplified JMS 2.0 API.
<P>
The CDI dependency injection facility introduced in Java EE 6 will be
enhanced as well as more broadly utilized by the Java EE platform
technologies.
<P>
We expect the managed bean model to be further refined and expanded so
as to remove as many inconsistencies as possible across Managed Beans,
EJB, Servlets, JSF, CDI and JAX-RS.  As an example, we plan to make
available the declarative transaction functionality introduced by EJB
in a more general way through CDI interceptors, so that it may be
leveraged by other managed beans.
<P>
We expect to expand the scope of the ease of use facility of Bean
Validation, extending it to the automatic validation of method
invocations and integrating it with the CDI interceptor facility.
<P>
Ease of development encompasses ease of configuration as well.  To
that end, we plan to broaden the resource definition facilities
introduced in Java EE 6 to encompass more of the standard platform
resource types, and also provide default database and JMS connection
factory resources.  We plan to improve the configuration of
application security, including new descriptors for security
permissions.
<P>
Although Java EE 7 will build on Java SE 7, we will encourage
component JSRs to review and improve their APIs with the coming Java
SE 8 language changes in mind, so that enterprise developers will be
able to take advantage of the new language features as soon as Java SE
8 is released.

<P>
- Infrastructure for cloud support - 
<P>
In Java EE 7 we expect to lay groundwork for enhancements to the
platform for use in cloud environments in a future Java EE 8 release.
Areas that we expect to address encompass some of those mentioned above,
and include resource definition metadata, improved security
configuration, and database schema generation.

<P>

<FONT SIZE="+2">Section 2: Request</FONT><P>
</P>

<H4>2.1 Please describe the proposed Specification:</H4>

<P>This JSR is to develop Java EE 7, the next release of the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition.
<P>
The main theme for this release is the Cloud. The Java EE platform is already well suited for cloud environments thanks to its container-based model and the abstraction of resource access it entails. In this release we aim to further enhance the suitability of the Java EE platform for cloud environments. As a result, Java EE 7 products will be able to more easily operate on private or public clouds and deliver their functionality as a service with support for features such as multitenancy and elasticity (horizontal scaling). Applications written for Java EE 7 will be better able to take advantage of the benefits of a cloud environment.
<P>
- Cloud -
<P>
In the Platform as a Service (PaaS) model, applications from one customer can be deployed to the cloud and take advantage of services provided by the hosting environment alongside other applications belonging to other customers, with the appropriate guarantees in terms of security, isolation, quality of service, etc. Similarly, a single application can be used by multiple tenants with the same security, isolation, and quality of service guarantees.
<P>
Since its inception, Java EE has offered a managed environment in which access to the system and any external resources, such as relational databases, is controlled and mediated by containers. This container-based model has allowed portable applications to target single-machine deployments as well as large cluster installations without fundamental changes to the programming model. We see the cloud as a further evolution of this paradigm and propose to address it via some incremental changes to the existing (and popular) Java EE programming model.
<P>
This JSR will extend the Java EE platform architecture to take into account the operational impact of the Cloud, more specifically by defining  new roles that arise in that model, such as PaaS administrator. It will also review, and if needed update, the security architecture in Java EE to take into account the needs of the PaaS model. This JSR may also establish a set of constraints that applications that wish to take advantage of PaaS-specific features, such as multitenancy, may have to obey and provide a way for applications to identify themselves as designed for cloud environments.
<P>
We expect most technologies that are part of the platform to be updated to take into consideration the new requirements of the cloud model. In particular, all resource manager-related APIs, such as JPA, JDBC and JMS, will be updated to enable multitenancy. The programming model may be refined as well, for example by introducing connectionless versions of the major APIs. The model for exposing resources to applications will need to be reviewed with the PaaS in mind; for example, it may be necessary to enable certain external resources, such as data sources and message queues, to be tagged as shared by multiple applications. The expert groups governing the individual technologies will be tasked with identifying any such needs and taking the appropriate measures to ensure they are addressed.
<P>
This JSR will define a descriptor for application metadata to enable developers to describe certain characteristics of their applications that are essential for the purpose of running them in a PaaS environment. These may include: being multitenancy-enabled, resources sharing, quality of service information, dependencies between applications. The application metadata facility will be extensible; we envision defining an initial set of standard metadata attributes in this release and expanding it in future versions of the platform.
<P>
- Latest web standards -
<P>
We expect the Java EE 7 platform to add first-class support for some of the recent developments in the web space, including HTML5 and Web Sockets. It will also include a modern HTTP client API as defined by the JAX-RS 2.0 JSR.
<P>
- Ease of development -
<P>
On the ease of development front, Java EE 7 will include a revised JMS 2.0 API.
<P>
We expect the dependency injection facility introduced in Java EE 6 to be updated for this release with the addition of an API to configure an injector. Such an API will be defined in the DI 1.1 JSR (a follow-up to JSR-330) and supported by CDI 1.1.
<P>
We also expect the managed bean model to be further refined and expanded so as to remove as many inconsistencies as possible across Managed Beans, EJB, Servlets, JSF, CDI and JAX-RS.
<P>
Although Java EE 7 will build on Java SE 7, we will encourage component JSRs to review and improve their APIs with the coming Java SE 8 language changes in mind, so that enterprise developers will be able to take advantage of the new language features as soon as Java SE 8 is released.
<P>

    <a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.107.html">JCache (JSR-107)</a><BR>
<P>
Several of the technologies already included in the Java EE platform are expected to be updated for the Java EE 7 release, including all or some of the following:
<P>

    Java Connector Architecture
<P>
We'd like to solicit community contributions in the following areas with an eye on including these technologies in Java EE 7 should their schedule allow it:
<P>
    Java Web Sockets API (TBD)<BR>
    Java JSON API (TBD)<BR>
<P>
Some of the new component JSRs we are proposing for inclusion add significant capabilities to the platform: JCache enables scaling of applications by standardizing a powerful caching layer accessible from all containers; the Concurrency Utilities for Java EE API builds on the java.util.concurrent API in Java SE and offers a context- and transaction-aware API for asynchronous tasks.
<P>

<P>
- Modularity -
<P>
Last but not least, this JSR will investigate providing modularity and versioning capabilities sufficient to cover common developer use cases, such as using a later version of an API already included in the platform. This work will need to be coordinated with the upcoming modularity JSR for Java SE so as to provide alignment across the SE and EE platforms.



 </P>

<H4>2.2 What is the target Java platform? (i.e., desktop, server, personal, embedded, card, etc.)</H4>

<P>This specification defines a release of the Java EE platform.</P>

<H4>2.3 The Executive Committees would like to ensure JSR submitters think about how their proposed technology relates to all of the Java platform editions. Please provide details here for which platform editions are being targeted by this JSR, and how this JSR has considered the relationship with the other platform editions.</H4>

<P>This JSR updates the Java EE platform and the Java EE Web Profile.

</P>

<H4>2.4 Should this JSR be voted on by both Executive Committees?</H4>

<P>No. By the SE/EE EC only.

</P>


<H4>2.5 What need of the Java community will be addressed by the proposed specification?</H4>

<P>See 2.1 above.</P>

<H4>2.6 Why isn't this need met by existing specifications?</H4>

<P>See 2.1 above.</P>

<H4>2.7 Please give a short description of the underlying technology or technologies:</H4>

<P>A detailed description of Java EE functionality can be found in the Java EE Specification, see <a href="/en/jsr/detail.id.316.html">http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=316</a>.


</P>

<H4>2.8 Is there a proposed package name for the API Specification? (i.e., <TT>javapi.something</TT>, <TT>org.something</TT>, etc.)</H4>

<P>The Java EE platform itself does not require a package name. All of its requirements are reflected in the packages of its constituent Java APIs.

</P>

<H4>2.9 Does the proposed specification have any dependencies on specific operating systems, CPUs, or I/O devices that you know of?</H4>

<P>No.</P>

<H4>2.10 Are there any security issues that cannot be addressed by the current security model?</H4>

<P>Java EE 7 addresses mechanisms and policies required for secure usage of its constituent component models and access APIs. These mechanisms must be compatible with the security facilities of Java SE 7.
<P>
Java EE 7 may define additional Service Provider Interfaces, including those that allow security technology vendors to integrate with Java EE application servers.

</P>

<H4>2.11 Are there any internationalization or localization issues?</H4>

<P>Java EE uses the I18N support in Java SE and defined in constituent technologies.

</P>

<H4>2.12 Are there any existing specifications that might be rendered obsolete, deprecated, or in need of revision as a result of this work?</H4>

<P>Other than the Java EE specification itself, the Java EE Web Profile specification and the new versions of their constituent components, Java EE 7 should not require other existing specifications to be revised.

</P>
