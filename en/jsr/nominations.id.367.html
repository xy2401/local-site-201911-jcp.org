            <td width="40%">I am a Software Engineer graduated from Gdansk University of Technology in 2004, specialized in distributed information systems. From the beginning I worked with Java/Java EE and different object-to-xyz mapping/binding technologies (including early Hibernate, Xml Beans and JAXB implementations).
I also worked a lot with Servlet, low- and high-level HTTP frameworks, entensively used XML (and XSD) and Fast Infoset, little less of JSON. I'm a Certified Java Developer (SCJD) and Web Component Developer (SCWCD).
I worked for Lufthansa Systems, Intel Corporation in Poland and Amadeus S.A.S in France (current employer) where I am a part of Java middleware team. I understand binding needs from both user and middleware perspective.

During 10 years of my professional adventure I extensively used different open-source technologies and it's high time to give something back. That's why I nominate myself to participate in "JSR 367 - Java API for JSON Binding" expert group.</td>

He is an Apache committer (Apache TomEE) and also an EG member. Karan has spent a major part of his career in training developers and architects on various java technologies and tools/frameworks. As a result, Karan has seen and worked closely with a lot of developers; both in large and small organizations. Karan understands how developers work with API's, their learning curve, and why developers actually become (un)successful working with and implementing newer technologies/standards into their projects. Karan can also make a significant contribution to this project in terms of documenting the JSR so that it is very readable even by ordinary developers.</td>
