<a name="updates"><font size="+2">Updates to the Original Java Specification Request (JSR)</font></a><p>
The following updates have been made to <a href="#orig">the original request</a>.
<P>
<B><U>2006.02.22</u></B>:<BR>
The summary was updated from: "This JSR is to develop Java EE 5, the next release of the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition, targeted to ship in the second half of 2005."
<P>
<H4>2.1 Please describe the proposed Specification:</H4>

<P>This JSR is to develop Java EE 5, the next release of the Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup>
Platform, Enterprise Edition, targeted to ship in the second quarter of 2006.
<P>
The major theme for the next version of Java EE is ease of development. The clear message we've heard from Java EE vendors and users is that the Java EE platform must evolve quickly to support a wider range of developers, including less sophisticated developers.&nbsp; JSR-175 (A Metadata Facility for the Java<sup><font size="-2"><small><small>TM</small></small></font></sup>
Programming Language) is the enabling facility for a new declarative style of programming that significantly simplifies many programming tasks.&nbsp; Java EE must move quickly to take advantage of this capability and deliver significant improvements to ease of development for Java EE developers. In particular, this capability will be used to simplify the development of web service applications.<br>
</p>
<p>J2EE 1.4 delivered basic web services support, including support for the WS-I Basic Profile, for the Java platform.&nbsp; Web service standards continue to evolve and it is critical that the Java platform support the latest web service standards.<br>
</p>
<p>We propose that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Java EE 5 will define the Java EE component model, deployment, packaging, and container requirements for Java EE components that use Java language annotations, as defined by Java EE component JSRs.</li>
  <li>Java EE 5 will further define the Java EE component model, deployment, packaging, and container requirements for Java EE components that provide or use web services. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Java EE 5 may also provide minor enhancements to existing APIs and small additional APIs, provided
they meet the time and resource constraints of this release.
</p>
<p>This JSR will not itself define any new APIs, rather it will enumerate APIs defined in other JSRs or through the JCP maintenance process. We propose to include the following new APIs or API revisions in Java EE 5 in support of the above goals:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Java EE 5 is the Enterprise Edition of version 5 of the Java platform, and thus will be built on J2SE 5.0.
    <p>The following JSRs directly support the ease of development goals of Java EE 5. </p>
  </li>
  <li>JSR-181 (Web Services Metadata for the Java Platform) </li>
  <li>JSR-220 (EJB 3.0) </li>
  <li>JSR-222 (JAXB 2.0) </li>
  <li>JSR-224 (JAX-WS 2.0)</li>
  <li>JSR-127 (JavaServer Faces 1.0)</li>
  <li>JSR-52 (JSTL 1.1)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, to smooth the integration of JSF with JSP, a revision of the JSP specification will be required to integrate the two technologies and to resolve differences in their expression
languages.&nbsp; A JSR will be filed shortly to cover this work.<br>
</p>
<p>We believe that it is critical to deliver a Java EE platform with enhanced ease of development as soon as possible. To be successful, the target feature set will need to be carefully managed. Very few technologies that aren't already well defined will be able to be included, and such new technologies will need to be tightly focused
on the essential items necessary for enhanced ease of development support.
</p>
<p>Nearly all of the JSRs listed above are well underway. Spec leads for all included JSRs will need to remain focused on the goal of delivering enhanced ease of development support in Java EE
5 as soon as possible. Those that complete in time will be included in Java EE 5. Those that fail to complete in time may not be included.<br>
</p>


<H4>2.13 Please describe the anticipated schedule for the development of this
specification.</H4>

<P>We hope to deliver the final specification, reference implementation, and TCK in the first quarter of 2006. This implies that the specification must reach Proposed Final Draft in the third quarter of 2005.&nbsp; A rough schedule would be:<br>

At JavaOne 2005, Sun announced new naming for the Java platform.  "J2EE 5.0" will now be known as "Java EE 5". Names of previous releases are not changed.
<P>
<B><u>18 July 2005</u></b>:
<BR>
The name of the JSR was changed from "Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition 5.0 (J2EE 5.0) Specification" to "Java Platform, Enterprise Edition 5 (Java EE 5) Specification". The summary was similarly updated.

  <li>JSR-222 (JAXB 2.0) </li>
  <li>JSR-224 (JAX-WS 2.0)</li>

</ul>
<p>In addition, to smooth the integration of JSF with JSP, a revision of the JSP specification will be required to integrate the two technologies and to resolve differences in their expression
languages.&nbsp; A JSR will be filed shortly to cover this work.<br>
</p>
<p>We believe that it is critical to deliver a Java EE platform with enhanced ease of development as soon as possible. To be successful, the target feature set will need to be carefully managed. Very few technologies that aren't already well defined will be able to be included, and such new technologies will need to be tightly focused
on the essential items necessary for enhanced ease of development support.
</p>
<p>Nearly all of the JSRs listed above are well underway. Spec leads for all included JSRs will need to remain focused on the goal of delivering enhanced ease of development support in Java EE
5 as soon as possible. Those that complete in time will be included in Java EE 5. Those that fail to complete in time may not be included.<br>

<H4>2.2 What is the target Java platform? (i.e., desktop, server, personal, embedded, card, etc.)</H4>

<P>This specification defines the next release of the Java EE Platform.</P>


<H4>2.3 The Executive Committees would like to ensure JSR submitters think about how their proposed technology relates to all of the Java platform editions. Please provide details here for which platform editions are being targeted by this JSR, and how this JSR has considered the relationship with the other platform editions.</H4>

<P>This specification defines the next release of the Java EE Platform. It will be based on the corresponding release of the Java SE platform.</P>

<H4>2.5 What need of the Java community will be addressed by the proposed specification?</H4>

<P>Java EE 5 will extend J2EE 1.4 and build on J2SE 5.0, taking particular advantage of JSR-175 to make development of applications on the Java EE platform significantly easier, thus making Java EE attractive to a broader range of developers.

<H4>2.8 Is there a proposed package name for the API Specification? (i.e., <TT>javapi.something</TT>, <TT>org.something</TT>, etc.)</H4>

<P>The Java EE Platform itself does not require a package name. All of its requirements are reflected in the packages of its constituent Java
APIs.</P>

<H4>2.10 Are there any security issues that cannot be addressed by the current security model?</H4>

<P>Java EE 5 addresses mechanisms and policies required for secure usage of its constituent component models and access APIs. These mechanisms must be compatible with the security facilities of J2SE 5.0.</P>

<H4>2.11 Are there any internationalization or localization issues?</H4>

<P>The Java EE technologies face cross-platform internationalization issues such as locale and character encoding identification and support for the latest Unicode version, as well as technology-specific internationalization issues. The component JSRs need to address these issues, leveraging the internationalization functionality provided by the Java SE platform where possible.</P>

<H4>2.12 Are there any existing specifications that might be rendered obsolete, deprecated, or in need of revision as a result of this work?</H4>

<P>Other than the Java EE specification itself and the new versions of its constituent component models and access APIs, Java EE 5 should not require other existing specifications to be revised.</P>

<H4>2.13 Please describe the anticipated schedule for the development of this
specification.</H4>

<P>We hope to deliver the final specification, reference implementation, and TCK in the first quarter of 2006. This implies that the specification must reach Proposed Final Draft in the third quarter of 2005.&nbsp; A rough schedule would be:<br>

</P>

<H4>2.1 Please describe the proposed Specification:</H4>

<P>This JSR is to develop J2EE 5.0, the next release of the Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> 2
Platform, Enterprise Edition, targeted to ship in the second half of
2005.
</p>
<p>The major theme for the next version of J2EE is ease of development.
The clear message we've heard from J2EE vendors and users is
that the J2EE platform must evolve quickly to&nbsp; support a wider
range of developers, including less sophisticated developers.&nbsp;
JSR-175 (A Metadata Facility for the Java<sup><font size="-2"><small><small>TM</small></small></font></sup>
Programming
Language) is the enabling facility for a new declarative style of
programming that significantly simplifies many programming tasks.&nbsp;
J2EE must move quickly to take advantage of this capability and deliver
significant improvements to ease of development for J2EE developers. In
particular, this capability will be used to simplify the development of
web service applications.<br>
</p>
<p>J2EE 1.4 delivered basic web services support, including support for
the WS-I Basic Profile, for the Java platform.&nbsp; Web service
standards continue to evolve and it is critical that the Java platform

support the latest web service standards.<br>
</p>
<p>We propose that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>J2EE 5.0 will define the J2EE component model, deployment,
packaging,
and container requirements for J2EE components that use Java language
annotations, as defined by J2EE component JSRs.</li>
  <li>J2EE 5.0 will further define the J2EE component model,
deployment,
packaging,
and container requirements for J2EE components that provide or use web
services. </li>
</ul>
<p>
J2EE 5.0 may also provide minor enhancements to existing APIs and small
additional APIs, provided
they meet the time and resource constraints of this release.
</p>
<p>This JSR will not itself define any new APIs, rather it will
enumerate APIs defined in other JSRs or through the JCP
maintenance process. We propose to include the following
new APIs or API revisions in J2EE 5.0 in support of the above goals:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>J2EE 5.0 is the Enterprise Edition of version 5.0 of the Java
platform,
and thus will be built on J2SE 5.0.
    <p>The following JSRs directly support the ease of development
goals of J2EE 5.0. </p>
  </li>
  <li>JSR-181 (Web Services Metadata for the Java Platform) </li>
  <li>JSR-220 (EJB 3.0) </li>
  <li>JSR-222 (JAXB 2.0) </li>
  <li>JSR-224 (JAX-RPC 2.0)</li>
  <li>JSR-127 (JavaServer Faces 1.0)</li>
  <li>JSR-52 (JSTL 1.1)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, to smooth the integration of JSF with JSP, a revision
of the JSP specification will be required to integrate the two
technologies and to resolve differences in their expression
languages.&nbsp; A JSR will be filed shortly to cover this work.<br>
</p>
<p>We believe that it is critical to deliver a J2EE platform with
enhanced
ease of development as soon as possible. To be successful, the
target feature set will need to be carefully managed. Very few
technologies that aren't already well defined will be able to be
included, and such new technologies will need to be tightly focused
on the essential items necessary for enhanced ease of development
support.
</p>
<p>Nearly all of the JSRs listed above are well underway. Spec leads
for all
included JSRs will need to remain focused
on the goal of delivering enhanced ease of development support in J2EE
5.0 as soon as
possible. Those that complete in time will be included in J2EE 5.0.
Those that fail to complete in time may not be included.<br>

</P>

<H4>2.6 Why isn't this need met by existing specifications?</H4>

<P>While existing (in progress) specifications provide the base capabilities, no other specification can unite these components into a coherent Java platform. </P>

<H4>2.7 Please give a short description of the underlying technology or technologies:</H4>

<P>A detailed description of J2EE 1.4 functionality can be found in the
J2EE 1.4 Specification <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/docs.html#specs">http://java.sun.com/j2ee/download.html#platformspec</a>.</P>

<H4>2.8 Is there a proposed package name for the API Specification? (i.e., <TT>javapi.something</TT>, <TT>org.something</TT>, etc.)</H4>

<P>The J2EE Platform itself does not require a package name. All of its
requirements are reflected in the packages of its constituent Java
APIs.</P>

<font color="red">NOTE</font>: this information <a href="#updates">has been updated</a> from this original request.
<P>

<H4>2.9 Does the proposed specification have any dependencies on specific operating systems, CPUs, or I/O devices that you know of?</H4>

<P>No</P>

<H4>2.10 Are there any security issues that cannot be addressed by the current security model?</H4>

<P>J2EE 5.0 addresses mechanisms and policies required for secure usage
of
its constituent component models and access APIs. These mechanisms must
be compatible with the security facilities of J2SE 5.0.</P>

<font color="red">NOTE</font>: this information <a href="#updates">has been updated</a> from this original request.
<P>

<H4>2.11 Are there any internationalization or localization issues?</H4>

<P>The J2EE technologies face cross-platform internationalization issues such as locale and character encoding identification and support for the latest Unicode version, as well as technology-specific internationalization issues. The component JSRs need to address these issues, leveraging the internationalization functionality provided by the J2SE platform where possible.</P>

<P>

<H4>2.12 Are there any existing specifications that might be rendered obsolete, deprecated, or in need of revision as a result of this work?</H4>

<P>Other than the J2EE specification itself and the new versions of its constituent component models and access APIs, J2EE 5.0 should not require other existing specifications to be revised.</P>

<H4>2.14 Please describe the anticipated working model for the Expert Group working on developing this
specification.</H4>

<P>The primary means of communication will be email, with conference calls and face-to-face meetings scheduled as needed.</P>

<H4>2.15 It is important to the success of the community and each JSR that the work of the Expert Group be handled in a manner which provides the community and the public with insight into the work the Expert Group is doing, and the decisions that the Expert Group has made. The Executive Committees would like to ensure Spec Leads understand the value of this transparency and ask that each JSR have an operating plan in place for how their JSR will address the involvement of the community and the public. Please provide your plan here, and refer to the Spec Lead Guide for a more detailed description and a set of example questions you may wish to answer in your plan.</H4>

<P>Transparency plan:<P>

a) The specification lead will maintain an interest list for JCP members outside of the Expert Group. The specification lead will publish periodic milestone drafts and status to this list. The Expert Group may also use the list to request feedback on key issues facing the group.<P>

b) The specification lead will on a quarterly basis provide a brief JSR status to the JCP PMO, for publication to the Java community. This will include the current schedule for the JSR and notes on any major events that have occurred in the previous quarter.
