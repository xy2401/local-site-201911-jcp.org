Rudy De Busscher is a Java EE Expert who has done several projects with a multitude of technologies, most of the time with JSF in the front. He has given training to many developers and students and has coached various teams. Always explaining state of the art technologies and how you can build applications today for tomorrow. 

Qualifications:
* I have created the Octopus Framework (see also http://javaeesquad.blogspot.be/2014/03/octopus-framework.html) 
It gives you a permission based security framework for Java EE which is highly customizable, CDI integrated and focused on type-safety. You can protect URL�s, JSF components, CDI methods and EJB invocations with one and the same permission check code. 

* I have done several projects where security is an important aspect. In the following projects, aspects like authentication, authorization and encryption are used.
- LIMS (Labo Information Management System) project. Manages the analysis of samples in a laboratory. Patient confidentiality is an import aspect here and thus several security levels are applied.
- REST backend for a mobile application used by home nursing personal.  It gathers all personal and health information of the visited persons.  Again patient confidentiality is important here.
- KBO-WI, the central registry for enterprises and self employed of the Belgian government. Contains among others name, address and allowed activities</td>

            <td width="40%">This nominee, henceforth called "I", has successfully created a JASPIC SAM based on various other standards, like SAML and JSON Web Tokens.

While struggling with JASPIC, I discovered that it really is low level and found a lot of holes and opportunities for improvement. I ended up having a fruitful discussion with Arjan Tijms based on a simple StackOverflow question. He pointed me towards the JASPIC specs and its issues. 

Now that I've found out about this shiny new API which looks like it will modernize JASPIC, it seems a perfect moment to join and do my part.

My JASPIC SAM uses the SAML AuthnRequest / Response protocol (HTTP POST) and validates JSON Web Tokens to simplify authentication for underlying applications. Currently it's used for simple JSP, REST services and SOAP services: all use Servlets underneath so they all go through the SAM. At first, a user goes to a webpage and needs to authenticate and this is done with SAML. After he is authenticated and comes back to the site, the site can create tokens for the user (with getUserPrincipal) and use those tokens for  REST services on another server. The other server has the same SAM installed, validates the tokens, gets the subject from it and installs that into the UserPrincipal so once again, the REST service can simply call getUserPrincipal.</td>
